  CSE 30 Autograder Notes

- Make sure you have the right executable in ~cs30xzz/pa2
- make sure cs30xzz runs turnin on pa2 before you collect the assignments and run the autograder.
- Make sure you remove all the .html files in ~cs30x3/public_html/scores
- Make sure you have the right pa2.guideline in the ~cs30x3/guidelines
- Double check the permissions on the cs30xAA folders in grading/pa2 when you distribute (the last folder didn't have group write permissions for some reason when I did it so I had to manually chmod them)
- Make sure you send/collect gradesheets
