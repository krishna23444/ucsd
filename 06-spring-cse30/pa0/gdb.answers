Here are some answers Victoria came up with:
Answers don't have to be exactly as below, but should reflect the basic
correct
idea. ( I hope the answers are right I sort of answered then as I
remembered
without going through the GDB...)

1) 1: x/i $pc  0x10564 <main+4>:   sethi  %hi(0x10400), %o1

2) You should see the next line.

3) Joe Jane Student. The string that is passed in as a parameter (their
name).

4) Should be the length of the string. How ever long there name is
   plus hello: length of "Hello Joe Jane Student "

5) x/s - prints the string at the memory address stored in the register
   p/d - prints the decimal value of the varieble in the register

6) next  - executes until the next source (C code ) line is reached
   nexti - .... until next machine instruction is reached

7) step  - until next source line is reached, but steps in the call
function
   stepi - until next instruction is reached, steps in the call function
   as opposed to next.

When in doubt about an answer, please email me or Rick just to make sure:)
