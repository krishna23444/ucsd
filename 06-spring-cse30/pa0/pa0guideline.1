Hi everybody,

pa0 has been sent through the autograder, and will be in your directories
soon (probably before you get this email).  You should have your grading
done by next thursday (4/18/02) night.  That means when I wake up on
Friday, you should all be done.

Be sure to nail the students on their style now when it doesn't cost much
pointwise, and let them know what is expected of them in terms of style
(no more than 80 chars per line, function headers, file headers, inline
comments, good and consistent indentation following the guideline supplied
at the end of the pa1 write-up,and anything else like that).

For those who have not graded for this class before:

You will be given several tools to assist with your grading.  You will
have two scripts in your ~/Assignments/pa0 directory (which is where all
the files to grade are as well) called "mailer" and "extract."  For each
file, there is a line that contains "cs30x[a-b]*" in the middle of it.
You need to change the [a-b] part to be the range of students that you
are grading (you might have some cs30xf's and some cs30xe's for example,
so you would make it "cs30x[e-f]*").  Then you can run the "extract"
script (by typing the name of the script) and it will unzip and untar the
program files for each of the students you need to grade.  The "mailer"
script is for use when you have finished grading all of your students.
When all of their grades are recored, and their guidelines complete, then
you can run the mailer script to send the students their grades.

You will also have a file called "cs30x??.grades" in which you should
recored the grades for each student (for me to collect later) when you
finish them.

Within each subdirectory of ~/Assignments/pa0 there will be a
cs30x??.diffs, cs30x??.output, and "guideline" file.  The *.diffs file
shows the student's output with a "<" in front of it and the correct
output with a ">" in front of it.  You should compare any differences and
make sure that they are really different before taking off any points for
correctness.  There is only one test case for this assignment, and it
should only be different on the line with their name and the one with
their birthday (as the code was given out in class).  If you don't know
how to read the diff file, email me and we'll set a time to meet and go
over them.

The *.output file is broken up by test case as well.  Each one has the
complete output from the student and the correct output (labeled as such)
for you to compare.  You can use either the *.output, *.diffs, or both as
you see fit to determine if the student passed their test cases.

The guideline file will have a list of all the things that they can lose
points for and how much to take off for each thing.  You should change
this file to reflect where they lost points as it will be attached to the
email sent to them with their grade.

A file called pa0.answers should be in your ~/Assignments/pa0 directory as
well. I didn't write these answers, but they're good enough for me.

If you have any questions on whether something works as a valid answer to
the gdb questions, you can email me (cs30x2).

I think that's it.  If there are any questions at all, feel free to email
me at cs30x2@ieng9.ucsd.edu.

Jonathan
