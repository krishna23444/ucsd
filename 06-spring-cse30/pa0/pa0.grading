Hi everybody,

PA0 has been collected, graded and distributed to each of your home
directories. Please start and finish grading as soon as possible. This is a
very short assignment, so I expect to have all grading completed by
Thursday morning at 8am.

Since this is the first assignment, the bulk of their points will be from
their answers to the GDB questions in their README file. The remaining 30
points will be awarded for style and compiling. Be sure to take off points
now and warn them about those types of points, like style (spaces, indenting,
comment blocks, file headers, keeping within 80 columns, etc.) and compiler
warnings (make sure they understand to (void) the printf's)--we want to make
them aware of these important points so that they won't make the same
mistakes after this.

The answers to the README questions are in each student's directory, in a
file named pa0.answers. I've used the exact same one from previous
quarters, though I've finally updated it to make a little more sense. Give
them full credit if they've got.

For those of you new to grading, or new to CS30 grading, it's pretty
simple. In your home directories you will find a subdirectory called
Assignments, which will be where all the graded assignments will go. For
pa0, you will see a list of students in ~/Assignments/pa0, along with a
cs30x##.grades file, and two scripts, extract and mailer. The first thing
you should do is run the extract script, which will un-tar each of the
students program submission so that you can examine their source code. In
each student directory, there will be, in addition to the source files,
three more files: cs30x??.diffs, cs30x??.output and guideline. The
guideline file is what you will be editing to add/subtract points and to
provide feedback to the student. This is what the student will receive when
you run the mailer script. The .diffs file and the .output file are very
important--they contain the output of the autograder running the student's
program. In particular, the .output file has the output of every single
test case, each showing the output of the student's program, immediately
followed by "CORRECT OUTPUT" which is just the output of pa0test. Those of
you with keen eyes or good students, or both can examine the .diffs file
which is the .output file but in a diff format, which highlights the
differences between the student's and the correct output. Basically the
lines that start with a '<' are output from the student's program, and '>'
indents the output from the correct output. If you have a hard time
reading it, stick with the .output file or ask me to show you. For this
assignment you will ALWAYS get some sort of entry int he .diffs file, since
no student should have put down "Joe Jane Student" with that December
birthday. In future assignments though, having a difference doesn't
necessarily mean points-off. Usually if it looks right or the message they
are trying to tell you is similar, then that's good enough. But it
certainly makes it easier for us to grade if their output is EXACTLY the
same--the .diffs file will be unusually empty in that case.

The students' grades will be recorded in the guideline file, which goes
back to them, and also the cs30x##.grades file, which I will collect on
Thursday. At the top of this file there is a self-explanatory "I am done"
line--change the "N" to "Y" when you are done.

Don't forget to run the mailer script when you are done as well, this is
the only way (for now, until I put the grades into GradeSource) the
students will find out how they did on their assignment. So if they come to
me saying they didn't receive a grade, I'm simply going to tell them to
talk to their grader (you guys) about it.

Oh yeah, some of you might only have a few to grade, while the rest of us
have six students each. Don't worry about it for now, I will adjust it for
the next assignment, since their might still be students who chose not to
do this assignment or added too late to have time to work on it.

I think that's it, but if you have any other questions or concerns, please
feel free to ask me, or give me an email at cs30x1@ieng9.ucsd.edu.

Jack

Ok I promise this will be the last one about pa0 you will hear from me...

When you run the mailer script, you might get some errors about "Unknown
tilde escape". Ignore those. The script itself still seems to work fine,
and the students seem to receive readable copies of the guideline email.
