Changes we made:
We implemented condition variables, locks, a synchronus mailbox, thread join,
priority scheduling, and whale matchmaking.
The majority of our code is in threads (.h and .cc) and synch (.h and .cc).
We also had to make a slight adjustment to List.cc in order to get sorted
insert to process things in decreasing order rather than increasing.

As far as we know, everything should work great.

We tested using a bunch of cases in the -q switch block, using the guidelines
on the assignment, as well as trying our own test ideas. For example, we tried
putting in a bunch of yields in weird places.

All of the members of our group sat together and worked on the same thing
at the same time, for all of the code-writing.  We brainstormed and debated
about implementation choices.  We tested both as a group and individually.
