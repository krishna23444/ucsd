Keep in mind that the goal of Exec is to create a new process and
start it running.  StartProcess does this, so it serves as the example
by which you should implement Exec and you should start by copying the
code from StartProcess into Exec.

Next you should think about why Exec and StartProcess are different.
The main reason is that StartProcess is called by the thread ("main")
that is going to run the bootstrap program, whereas Exec is called by
the parent process (which is already running a program) to create a
new process.  So Exec needs to fork off a new thread to run the
program in the process.

How do you run a program?  Well, StartProcess shows you how:
initialize the machine, and then make it Run.  However, StartProcess
can do this directly because the thread that is executing StartProcess
is the thread that is going to run the program.  If you do the same
thing in Exec, you will reinitialize the parent process to start at
the beginning (which is _not_ what you want to happen).  Remember, the
thread that is executing Exec is the parent, and the thread that is to
execute the new program is the thread that you create in Exec.  So you
need to arrange to have the new thread run the program, not the thread
that is executing in Exec.

What do you pass in to Fork()?  A function to make the above happen.
