Many more tests added, also with syntax errors; some previous
tests output has been corrected:
non typed functions, variable and parameter have now onyx.tyes.AnyType
the body of the programs is always inside an ExprList node

Two test cases added. Some test output has been corrected:
The body of programs are still always inside an ExprList.
The parameters of function calls are not enclosed in an ExprList node.
ExprLists are flattened.

There are two new test cases that show these behaviors:
- elflat.onyx
- fnelarg.onyx
