Programming assignment #1:  CSE 100 Spring 2005
</font>
</h2> <hr>

 <p> Here's a description of the first programming assignment for CSE
100, Spring 2005.  In this assignment, you will implement a Huffman
code file compressor and decompressor in Java.  
 </p><p>
&gt;&gt;&gt;  Due Monday, April 11, 6:00pm
 </p><p>
&gt;&gt;&gt; Required solution files:  Compress.java and Uncompress.java,
plus any other .java files in your working directory.  
 </p><p> The files that contain your solution to the
assignment must be turned in by the due deadline.  
 </p><p> To turn in your assignment, log in to your account on ieng9; prep
cs100s; cd to the directory containing your solution files; and run the
command <code>bundleP1</code>.  Follow the dialog.  This will bundle
together and turn in all and only the .java files in the directory.
Make sure that these are the files you want to turn in!  
 </p><p> If you are working in a team of 2 students, turn in your
assignment from <em>one</em> of your two accounts only.  In your
source code files, clearly document the names and login names of the
authors (using the javadoc <code>@author</code> tag in the javadoc
comment on each public class is the best way to do that).
 </p><p>
It's a good idea to plan to do the assignment well before the
deadlines; terminals and tutors can get very busy at the last minute.
 </p><p>
In doing this assignment, it's your responsibility to understand the
course rules for integrity of scholarship.

</p><h4> Getting started </h4> 
Read Weiss, Chapter 10 section 1; this assignment uses some concepts introduced
there.  Lecture notes on binary tries and Huffman code trees will
also be useful. 
 <p>
Create a directory named P1 under the home directory for your
CSE 100 class account on ieng9.  Your files 
should be bundled from that directory using the bundleP1 script
before the due time for the assignment.
 </p><p>

</p><h4> File compression and decompression</h4> 
 <p> Even though disk space and bandwidth is cheaper now than ever before in
history, there is also more data than ever before. So it is still 
very useful to be able to compress disk files and network data, 
thereby allowing a given
amount of disk to hold more data, or a given network link to carry
more data.  It is often possible to
significantly compress a file without any loss of information whatsoever
("lossless compression").  The
trick is to figure out how to do that, and how to 
reconstruct the original file when needed.
Here, we will implement file compression using Huffman coding, a clever
technique invented by David Huffman in 1952.  Huffman code compression
is used today as part of the JPEG image compression and the mp3
audio compression standards, and
in the Unix file compression command <code>pack</code>
(the popular <code>zip</code> and <code>gzip</code> compression utilities
use compression algorithms somewhat different from Huffman).
 </p><p>
You will write a Java program <code>Compress</code> that will be invoked with
a command line of the form
</p><pre>java Compress infile outfile
</pre>
When run, this program will read the contents of the file named by
its first command line argument, construct a Huffman code for the
contents of that file, and use that code to construct a compressed
version which is written to a file named by the second command line
argument.  The input file can contain any data (not just ASCII
characters) so it should be treated as a binary file.
The input file can be up to 100 megabytes in size
(so the same byte may occur up to 100 million times in the file).
 <p>
You will also write a Java program <code>Uncompress</code> 
that will be invoked with a command line of the form
</p><pre>java Uncompress infile outfile
</pre>
When run, this program will read the contents of the file named by
its first command line argument, which should be a file that has been
created by the Compress program.  It will use the contents of that
file to reconstruct the original, uncompressed version,
which is written to a file named by the second command line
argument.

<h4> Control flow </h4> 
Taking a top-down design approach to the problem, you can see that
your Compress program basically needs to go through these steps:
<ol>
<li> Open the input file for reading.
</li><li> Read bytes from the file, counting the number of occurrences of each
byte value; then close the file.
</li><li> Use these byte counts to construct a Huffman coding tree.
</li><li> Open the output file for writing. 
</li><li> Write enough information (a "file header") to the output file
file to enable the coding tree to be reconstructed when the file is
read by your Uncompress program.
</li><li> Open the input file for reading, again.
</li><li> Using the Huffman coding tree, translate each byte from the input file
into its code, and append these codes as a sequence of bits to the output
file, after the header.
</li><li> Close the input and output files.
</li></ol>
 <p> Your Uncompress program should go through these basic steps:
</p><ol>
<li> Open the input file for reading.
</li><li> Read the file header at the beginning of the input file, and reconstruct
the Huffman coding tree.
</li><li> Open the output file for writing.
</li><li> Using the Huffman coding tree, decode the bits from the input file
into the appropriate sequence of bytes, writing them to the output file.
</li><li> Close the input and output files.
</li></ol>

<h4> Data structures and object-oriented design </h4> 
 <p> The main data structure you will need in your solution is a binary
trie that represents a Huffman code.  In implementing Huffman's algorithm
to construct the trie, you will find it
convenient to use other data structures as well (for example, a priority queue
is useful, to maintain the forest of trees ranked by count).  
Any other data structures you find you need,
can be implemented in any way you wish; however, you should use good
object-oriented design in your solution.  For example, since a Huffman
code tree will be used by both your Compress and Uncompress classes,
it makes sense to encapsulate its functionality
in its own class, so that Compress and Uncompress can both use it.
With a good design, the main methods in the Compress and Uncompress
classes will be quite simple; they will create objects of other classes
and call their methods to do the necessary work.
 </p><p> One important design detail in this assignment is: how to
represent information about the Huffman code in the compressed file,
so the file can be correctly uncompressed.  Probably the easiest way
to do it is to save the frequency counts of the bytes in the original
uncompressed file as a sequence of 256 ints.  Since this is the information
that Compress uses to create the Huffman code in the first place, it
is sufficient.  However, it is not very efficient in terms of space:
it uses 1024 bytes of disk for the header no matter what the statistics of the 
input file are.  Alternative approaches use arrays to
represent the structure of the tree itself in the header.
It is possible to make do with about 2*C bytes, where C
is the number of distinct byte values that actually appear in the
input file.
 </p><p> One thing to watch out for is that all disk I/O operations (and
all memory read and write operations, for that matter) deal with a byte
as the smallest unit of storage.  To write a single bit to a file, or
to read a single bit from a file, involves using bitwise shift and
logical operations to manipulate the bits within a byte.  The number
of bits in the Huffman-compressed version of a file may not be a
multiple of 8; but the compressed file will always contain an integral
number of bytes.  You need a way to make sure that any "stray" bits at the
end of the last byte in the compressed file are not interpreted as
real code bits.  One way to do this is to store, in the compressed
file, the length in bytes of the uncompressed file, and use that
to terminate decoding.  (Note that the array of byte counts implicitly contains
that information already, 
since the sum of all of them is equal to the length in bytes of
the input file.)
</p><h4> Documentation </h4> 
 <p> Document your code.  For this assignment, you will not turn in a
separate user's manual; comments within the source code files
themselves will suffice, if they are clear, informative, compelete,
and  appropriately written.  Use "javadoc" comments to document each public
class, and each public method in each class.  Use "double-slash"
and/or "C-style" comments within method bodies and to document private
variables and methods.
 </p><p>
In the class comments for your Compress and Uncompress classes, clearly
describe how to use your programs, what their purpose is, and what their
limitations are.  Be sure to include <code>@author</code> tags to indicate
who wrote the code; both students' names and login names must appear
prominently in all source code files, 
if the assignment was done as a team.
 </p><p>
  To see what HTML documentation
files javadoc will create, run

</p><pre> javadoc -author *.java 
</pre> 

in your working directory.  Point a browser at the index.html file created there to see what
the resulting hyperlinked documentation looks like.
 <p>

</p><h4> Notes and hints </h4> 
 <p> Note that there are some differences between the requirements
of this assignment and the description of Huffman coding in the
textbook; for example, your program is required to
work on a file containing any data, not just ASCII characters.
 </p><p> The jarfiles RefCompress.jar and RefUncompress.jar in the
directory <code>~/../public/P1/</code> contain "reference" implementations
that satisfy the functional requirements of this assignment.  They
are the result of rather poor design, and it
is certainly possible to write a solution that is both faster and
that writes smaller compressed files.  Note that you run a Java jarfile with
a command of the form
</p><pre>java -jar &lt;jarfilename&gt;
</pre>
passing command line arguments as needed.
 <p>
For file I/O, you may find the java.io. classes <code>FileInputStream</code>,
<code>FileOutputStream</code>, <code>BufferedInputStream</code>,
<code>BufferedOutputStream</code>, <code>DataInputStream</code>, and
<code>DataOutputStream</code> useful.  See online or hardcopy Java
references for more information.
 </p><p>
To see the size of a file from the Unix command line, 
you can use the <code>ls</code> command with the<code>-l</code> flag:
</p><pre>ls -l words.cmp
</pre>
will display the size of <code>words.cmp</code> in bytes.
 <p>
To check if two files contain the same data, use the <code>diff</code> command.
For example,
</p><pre>diff foo bar
</pre>
will print nothing if <code>foo</code> and <code>bar</code> are identical.
If they are different, <code>diff</code> will print out some information
about how they differ.  This can be useful to test if your Uncompress
is really undoing what your Compress does!  (A Compress implementation
without a matching Uncompress implementation, or vice versa, is really
useless and will be graded accordingly.)

 <p>
To time a Unix command, pass the entire command line as an argument to
the <code>time</code> command.  For example,
</p><pre>time java Compress /usr/dict/words words.cmp
</pre>
will print out information about the time taken to run the command.
(The first number printed is the user-mode CPU time in seconds; see
<code>man time</code> for more information.)
 <p>
You should test your program as thoroughly as you can (we will certainly
test it as thoroughly as we can when grading it).  Be sure to test
on "corner cases": an empty file, 
files that contain only one character repeated many
times, etc.  "Working" means, at minimum, that running your Compress on
a file, and then running your Uncompress on the result, must reproduce the
original file.  There are some files
in public/P1 that may be useful as test cases, but you will want to test
on more than these.

</p><h4>Grading</h4> 

There are 25 possible points on the assignment.
If your solution files do not compile and link error-free, you will
recieve 0 points for this assignment.  We will compile your files with
the commands <code>javac Compress.java</code> and 
<code>javac Uncompress.java</code> using the
JDK on ieng9.  
<p>
To get full credit, style and comments (including
javadoc comments) count.  We will generate your documentation with
the command <code>javadoc -author *.java</code>.


</p><pre>15 points for Compress and Uncompress programs that use Huffman coding
to correctly compress and decompress files.
 <p>
2 points for a correct implementation of Compress that creates a smaller 
compressed file than the reference implementation when run on /usr/dict/words.
 </p><p>
2 points for a correct implementation of Compress that runs at least 25% faster
than the reference implementation when compressing /usr/dict/words.
 </p><p> 
2 points for a correct implementation of Uncompress that runs at
least 25% faster than the reference implementation when uncompressing
the compressed version of /usr/dict/words.
 </p><p>
4 points for a good object-oriented design, good coding style, and 
informative, well-written comments.
