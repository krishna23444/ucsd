<h2><font color="#0000ff">Programming assignment #2: CSE 100 Spring
2005
</font></h2>
<hr>
<p> Here's a description of the second programming assignment for CSE
100, Spring 2005. In this assignment, you will write two alternative
implementations of part of the Java Collections API, and write a
benchmarking program that compares them to an existing implementation. </p>
<p>&gt;&gt;&gt; Due Mon Apr 25, 6:00pm </p>
<p>&gt;&gt;&gt; Required solution files: TreapSet.java,
SkipListSet.java,
TestSets.java, TestSets.txt, together with any files in the
current working directory that match the patterns TreapSet*.java,
SkipListSet*.java </p>
<p> The files that contain your solution to the
assignment must be turned in by the due deadline. </p>
<p> To turn in your assignment, log in to your account on ieng9; prep
cs100s; cd to the account containing your solution files; and run the
command <code>bundleP2</code>. Follow the dialog. This will bundle
together and turn in only files matching the "Required solution files"
pattern
shown above.
Make sure that these are the files you want to turn in! </p>
<p> If you are working in a team of 2 students, turn in your
assignment from <em>one</em> of your two accounts only. In your
source code files, clearly document the names and login names of the
authors (using the javadoc <code>@author</code> tag in each javadoc
class comment is a good way to do that).
Remember that if you worked together with someone on your previous
assignment,
you must work with someone else this time, or work alone. </p>
<p>It's a good idea to plan to do the assignment well before the
deadlines; terminals and tutors can get very busy at the last minute. </p>
<p>In doing this assignment, it's your responsibility to understand the
course rules for integrity of scholarship.
</p>
<h3>1.&nbsp; Getting started </h3>
Read Pugh's paper on skip lists, and Aragon and Seidel's paper on
treaps. Also, read these sections of Weiss's textbook:
4.4.1 on AVL single rotations; 10.4.2 on skip lists;
12.5 on treaps; and Appendix B on the Collections API.
This assignment uses those concepts. You may find
lecture notes and discussion sections helpful as well.<br>
<br>
In this assignment, you will be defining and using classes that make
use of <span style="font-style: italic;">Java generics</span>.&nbsp;
Generics, introduced in JDK 1.5, permit type parameterization of
classes and methods using a syntax similar to that of C++
templates.
The features of Java generics are described briefly <a href="http://java.sun.com/developer/technicalArticles/J2SE/generics/">
in this article</a>, and explained at greater length in
<a href="http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.5/pdf/generics-tutorial.pdf">in
this
tutorial (PDF format)</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Review those documents
before
continuing; the requirements below assume familiarity with that
material.<br>
<p>Create a directory named P2 under the home directory for your
class account on ieng9. Your files should be bundled from that
directory using the bundleP2 script before the due time for the
assignment. </p>
<h3>2.&nbsp; Implementing the Java Collections Framework </h3>
<p> JDK versions since 1.2 provide a powerful, high-level data
structures library in the "Collections Framework". This framework
defines several interfaces, and defines some classes that implement
those
interfaces. The Collections classes and interfaces are in the
<code>java.util</code> package.&nbsp; Since JDK 1.5 these interfaces
are generic, and your implementations will be generic, i.e.
parameterized by the type of objects they contain.<br>
</p>
<p>These are the Collection Framework's main interfaces:
</p>
<ul>
  <li> <code>Collection&lt;E&gt;</code>: A group of elements of type <code>E</code>.
No assumptions are made about the
order of the collection (if any), or whether it may contain duplicate
elements.&nbsp; Extends the <code>Iterable&lt;E&gt;</code><code></code>
interface. </li>
  <li> <code>Set&lt;E&gt;</code>: A group of elements of type <code>E</code>
following
the familiar set abstraction. No duplicate elements permitted. May or
may not be ordered. Extends the <code>Collection&lt;E&gt;</code>
interface. </li>
  <li> <code>List&lt;E&gt;</code>: Ordered collection of elements of
type <code>E</code>, also known as a sequence. Duplicates are
generally permitted. Allows positional access. Extends the <code>Collection&lt;E&gt;</code>
interface. </li>
  <li> <code>Map&lt;K,V&gt;</code>: A mapping from keys of type <code>K</code>
to values of type <code>V</code>;
also known as a
"table" or "dictionary". Each key can map to at most one
value. (Note: does not extend Collection.) </li>
</ul>
In addition, there
are sorted versions of the
<code>Set</code> and <code>Map</code> interfaces:
<ul>
  <li> <code>SortedSet&lt;E&gt;</code>: A set whose elements are of
type <code>E</code> and
which are automatically
sorted, either in their natural ordering (see the <code>Comparable</code>
interface), or by a <code>Comparator</code>
object provided when a <code>SortedSet</code> instance is
created. Extends the <code>Set&lt;E&gt;</code> interface. </li>
  <li> <code>SortedMap&lt;K,V&gt;</code>: A map from keys of type <code>K</code>
to values of type <code>V</code></li>
  <li><code></code>&nbsp;whose mapping is
automatically sorted by key, either in the keys' natural ordering or
by a Comparator provided when a SortedMap instance is created. Extends
the <code>Map&lt;K,V&gt;</code> interface. </li>
</ul>
The Collections Framework also includes some classes that implement
the abovementioned interfaces:
<ul>
  <li> <code>HashSet&lt;E&gt;</code>: implements <code>Set&lt;E&gt;</code>,
using a hash table </li>
  <li> <code>TreeSet&lt;E&gt;</code>: implements <code>SortedSet&lt;E&gt;</code>
(and so also implments <code>Set&lt;E&gt;</code>), using a red-black
tree </li>
  <li> <code>HashMap&lt;K,V&gt;</code>: implements <code>Map&lt;K,V&gt;</code>,
using a hash table </li>
  <li> <code>TreeMap&lt;K,V&gt;</code>: implements <code>SortedMap&lt;K,V&gt;</code>,
using a red-black tree </li>
  <li> <code>ArrayList&lt;E&gt;</code>, <code>LinkedList&lt;E&gt;</code>:
implement <code>List&lt;E&gt;</code>, using an array and a linked list
respectively </li>
</ul>
In addition, the old <code>java.util.Hashtable</code> class from the
1.0 and 1.1 JDK's is slightly rewritten to implement <code>Map</code>,
and
<code>java.util.Vector</code> is declared to implement
<code>List</code>, and in 1.5 these containers are also generic.
<p>Any class that implements the the <code>Set&lt;E&gt;</code>
interface must provide definitions of these methods:
</p>
<pre>public interface Set&lt;E&gt; extends Collection&lt;E&gt; {<br>  public boolean add(E o);<br>  public boolean addAll(Collection&lt;? extends E&gt; c);<br>  public void clear();<br>  public boolean contains(Object o);<br>  public boolean containsAll(Collection&lt;?&gt; c);<br>  public boolean isEmpty();<br>  public Iterator&lt;E&gt; iterator();<br>  public boolean remove(Object o);<br>  public boolean removeAll(Collection&lt;?&gt; c);<br>  public boolean retainAll(Collection&lt;?&gt; c);<br>  public int size();<br>  public Object[] toArray();<br>  public &lt;T&gt;<t> T[] toArray(T[] a);<br>}<br></t></pre>
and the <code>SortedSet&lt;E&gt;</code> interface adds these:
<pre>public interface SortedSet&lt;E&gt; extends Set&lt;E&gt; {<br>  public Comparator&lt;? super E&gt; comparator();<br>  public E first();<br>  public SortedSet<e> headSet(E toElement);<br>  public E last();<br>  public SortedSet subSet(E fromElement, E toElement);<br>  public SortedSet tailSet(E fromElement);<br>}<br></e></pre>
The documentation for the <code>SortedSet&lt;E&gt;</code> interface
imposes further requirements on any class that implements it. These are
not enforced by
the compiler (and cannot be, given how the Java language is defined),
but programmers are expected to follow them:
<ol>
  <li> It must have a default constructor, and a constructor that takes
one argument of type <code>Comparator&lt;? super E&gt;</code>. </li>
  <li> If the <code>SortedSet&lt;E&gt;</code> is created using the
default
constructor, all contained objects must implement the <code>Comparable&lt;E&gt;</code>
interface, and all comparisons are done using the contained
objects' <code>compareTo()</code> methods (this is called the "natural
ordering"). </li>
  <li> If the <code>SortedSet&lt;E&gt;</code> is created using the
constructor that
takes a <code>Comparator&lt;? super E&gt;</code> argument, all
comparisons are done using that <code>Comparator</code>'s <code>compare()</code>
method. </li>
  <li> The <code>Iterator&lt;E&gt;</code> returned by the <code>iterator()</code>
method of a <code>SortedSet&lt;E&gt;</code>
must
iterate through the <code>SortedSet&lt;E&gt;</code> in order from
smallest to
largest, according to the "natural ordering" or the <code>Comparator</code>'s
ordering, as appropriate. </li>
</ol>
<p>In this assignment, you will define two generic classes that
implement the
<code>SortedSet&lt;E&gt;</code> interface. Your <code>TreapSet&lt;E&gt;</code>
class will
use a treap-based randomized search tree; your <code>SkipListSet&lt;E&gt;</code>
class
will use a nondeterministic skip list. You will collect benchmarks
comparing these to the "reference"
<code>java.util.TreeSet&lt;E&gt;</code> implementation. </p>
<p>Note: Though your <code>TreapSet&lt;E&gt;</code> and <code>SkipListSet&lt;E&gt;</code>
classes
must declare themselves to implement the <code>SortedSet&lt;E&gt;</code>
interface, for this
assignment
the only methods (besides the constructors) that we will test are
these:
</p>
<pre>  public boolean add(E o);<br>  public void clear();<br>  public boolean contains(Object o);<br>  public boolean isEmpty();<br>  public Iterator&lt;E&gt; iterator();<br>  public boolean remove(Object o);<br>  public int size();<br>  public Comparator&lt;? super E&gt; comparator();<br>  public E first();<br>  public E last();<br>  public Object[] toArray();<br></pre>
All the others need to be defined, but can just be defined as stubs
that throw an <code>UnsupportedOperationException</code>, and should
be commented
as such.
<h3>3.&nbsp; Benchmarking: TestSets.java, TestSets.txt </h3>
Red-black trees provide guaranteed O(log N) performance for add,
remove, and contains operations, but the add and remove operations are
quite tricky to code correctly. Pugh (for SkipLists) and Aragon and
Seidel (for treaps) claim that their datastructures are approximately
as efficient as highly optimized red-black
trees, while being much easier to implement. Here, you will
investigate these claims experimentally.
<p>Write a java program <code>TestSets</code> that tests the
performance
of the three <code>SortedSet</code> implementations. Interpret
"performance" to mean "how many comparisons were required to do a
<code>contains</code> operation, for successful and unsuccessful
lookups, in the best, worst, and average case". You can use an instance
of the
<code>CountingComparator</code> class (source in <code>~/../public/P2</code>)
to count comparisons. If your TreapSet class is coded correctly, the
number of comparisons will be equal to the number of nodes on the
path from the root of the tree to the node that contained the key you
were looking for (in the case of a successful find), or to the null
reference that terminated the search (in the case of an unsuccessful
find). Thus, these measurements can tell you the height of the tree
(from the maximum number of comparisons), and something about how full
it is (from the minimum and average number of
comparisons).
Analogous properties apply in the case of the SkipListSet class. </p>
<p> Collect your observations for a range of values of
<code>N</code>. For comparison purposes it is interesting to use values
of N of the form 2^H
- 1, since that many keys could be stored in an ideal, completely
filled binary search tree of height H-1, and the performance for such a
tree can easily be derived analytically.
Generate N distinct key values, and <code>add</code>
them to the <code>SortedSet</code> you are testing. Then do a
<code>contains</code> lookup for each of them (successful lookup); and
a contains lookup for N keys that are not in the
<code>SortedSet</code> (unsuccessful lookup), but are ordered among
the keys that are there (i.e. don't use test keys that all smaller or
all larger than the ones in the SortedSet because that would give
skewed results). You should do this several times for each N, to make
sure that the statistics are meaningful. Your program should output
the results in a nice tabular form; for example: </p>
<pre> <br>Successful finds; number of comparisons MIN/AVG/MAX: <br>Statistics collected over 16384/N runs, for each N.<br>		MysterySet1	MysterySet2	MysterySet3<br>N=00007: 	01/03/04 	01/03/07 	01/03/07<br>N=00015: 	01/04/06 	01/04/11 	01/04/13<br>N=00031: 	01/05/08 	01/05/14 	01/06/19<br>N=00063: 	01/06/10 	01/07/16 	01/07/21<br>N=00127: 	01/07/12 	01/08/19 	01/08/26<br>N=00255: 	01/08/14 	01/09/23 	01/10/28<br>N=00511: 	01/09/16 	01/11/23 	01/12/31<br>N=01023: 	01/10/18 	01/12/24 	01/13/29<br>N=02047: 	01/11/20 	01/14/28 	01/15/35<br>N=04095: 	01/12/22 	01/15/29 	01/15/35<br>N=08191: 	01/13/24 	01/16/34 	01/17/40<br>N=16383: 	01/14/26 	01/18/34 	01/18/38<br><br>Unsuccessful finds; Number of comparisons MIN/AVG/MAX:<br>Statistics collected over 16384/N runs, for each N.<br>		MysterySet1	MysterySet2	MysterySet3<br>N=00007: 	02/03/04 	01/04/07 	01/04/07<br>N=00015: 	03/04/06 	01/05/11 	01/05/14<br>N=00031: 	04/05/08 	01/06/15 	01/06/19<br>N=00063: 	05/06/10 	01/08/17 	01/08/24<br>N=00127: 	06/07/12 	02/09/20 	01/10/30<br>N=00255: 	07/08/14 	02/10/21 	01/11/27<br>N=00511: 	08/09/16 	02/12/22 	02/12/35<br>N=01023: 	09/10/18 	03/13/27 	02/14/33<br>N=02047: 	10/11/20 	03/14/29 	04/15/38<br>N=04095: 	11/12/22 	03/16/28 	04/17/35<br>N=08191: 	12/13/24 	04/17/33 	04/19/39<br>N=16383: 	13/14/26 	06/19/34 	05/21/37<br></pre>
<p>Collect the output of your benchmarking program into a file <code>TestSets.txt</code>
which you will turn in with your
source code files. In <code>TestSets.txt</code>, include one or two
paragraphs of clear English in which you interpret the data you
collected,
answering these questions:
Do all the implementations follow a O(log N) cost curve, in average and
worst case?
If so, what are the approximate constant factors hidden inside the O()?
How do these
structures compare to a perfectly balanced, completely filled
binary search tree? To a completely unbalanced binary search tree (i.e.
a linked list)? To an "average" BST (see the average case analysis
for successful finds in Lecture 5)?
</p>
<h3>4.&nbsp; Notes and hints </h3>
<ol>
  <li> Along with the TestSets files,
you must turn in files SkipListSet.java and TreapSet.java. You may also
turn in other java source code files with names
that start with "SkipListSet" and
"TreapSet"; for example you might want to have TreapSetNode.java or
TreapSetIterator.java which contain definitions of classes related to
TreapSet. Alternatively, Node and Iterator classes could be defined as
private inner classes. </li>
  <li> Be sure to read the official documentation (<a href="http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.5/docs/api/index.html">available
online</a>) of
the methods in the generic <code>SortedSet</code> and <code>Iterator</code>
interfaces, so
you
understand their semantics. Otherwise, it will be a miracle if you
implement them correctly. </li>
  <li> The implementation of <code>iterator()</code> method should
have
advantages
over <code>toArray()</code>. For example, it should be much more
efficient to iterate over say just the first 10 elements of a
1,000,000 element TreapSet using an Iterator than to use toArray()
and look at only the first 10 elements of the result.
Also, remove()
in an Iterator should be constant-time if possible, and so more
efficient
than a remove() in the backing collection, which does a full lookup of
the element to remove before removing it. The Iterator should "know"
which
element to remove() without having to search the backing collection at
all. </li>
  <li>If you still have questions about what the <code>SortedSet</code>
operations
require, you could create an instance of <code>java.util.TreeSet&lt;E&gt;</code>
for some type <code>E</code>
and call its methods. In
addition, the source
code for <code>TreeSet</code> (and for <code>TreeMap</code>, which it
uses)
is available for download as part of the 1.5 JDK, and for your
convenience also copied to <code>~/../public/P2/</code>
on ieng9, if you want to see what a well-written red-black tree
implementation looks like in Java.&nbsp;&nbsp; </li>
  <li> Source code for a Treap class is available in Weiss's book, and
online under <code>public/WeissCode/DataStructures</code>. You can
start
with that, if you find it convenient. The Pugh and Aragon and Seidel
papers
contain Algol-like source code; Weiss's Treap class code is essentially
a Java translation of the Aragon and Seidel published code. You will
need to modify the provided code quite extensively (it may be easier
to code from scratch). For example, the Weiss Treap code
calls the compareTo() method up to twice as many times as necessary; it
never makes use of a contained Comparator; etc. </li>
  <li> The <code>add</code> and <code>contains</code> methods are the
easiest to implement, and they are all you need in order to run the
benchmarks. You probably should do that first. The <code>iterator</code>
method, which involves implementing all the <code>Iterator</code>
methods
including <code>remove</code>, is probably the hardest. </li>
  <li> If you are working in a team of 2 developers, you might decide
to
have
one work on <code>TreapSet</code> and one on <code>SkipListSet</code>.
Be aware however that both of you will be expected to know about
implementation details of both these structures (for example, on
exams).</li>
  <li>Generics were introduced into Java to permit more extensive
compile-time type checking;&nbsp; the ideal is to have all possible
type errors detectedby the compiler.&nbsp; Some type-parameterized code
cannot be proved typesafe by the compiler, however, and in those cases the
1.5 compiler issues a warning about "unchecked" or "unsafe" operations.
&nbsp; (This just means that so far as the compiler can tell there
might be type errors that will be detected at runtime instead of
compile-time.)&nbsp; Details of these warnings can be seen&nbsp; by
using the<span style="font-family: monospace;"> -Xlint:unchecked</span>
flag to the compiler.&nbsp; You should work to reduce the number of
these warnings but in some circumstances it is impossible to eliminate
them (in fact the official standard java.util classes themselves do not
compile without warnings).&nbsp; If any of your methods might throw a
ClassCastException at runtime, this should be documented in a <span style="font-family: monospace;">@throws </span>clause in the Javadoc
comments for the method.</li>
  <li>Other nice feature sof Java 1.5 are automatic boxing and unboxing
of primitive types, and a new iteration syntax for containers that
implement the <span style="font-family: monospace;">Iterable</span>
interface.&nbsp; For example, previously you might write something like<br>
    <br>
    <span style="font-family: monospace;">TreapSet t = new TreapSet();<br>
t.add(new Integer(1)); t.add(new Integer(2)); t.add(new Integer(3));<br>
int sum = 0;<br>
for(Iterator i = t.iterator(); i.hasNext();) <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; sum += ((Integer)i.next()).intValue();<br>
System.out.println("Total: " + sum);<br>
    <br>
    </span>but in 1.5, this can be simplified to<br>
    <br>
    <span style="font-family: monospace;">TreapSet&lt;Integer&gt; t =
new TreapSet&lt;Integer&gt;();<br>
t.add(1); t.add(2); t.add(3);&nbsp; // automatic boxing<br>
int sum = 0;<br>
for(int i: t) // new iteration syntax<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; sum += i;&nbsp; // automatic unboxing<br>
System.out.println("Total: " + sum);<br>
    </span><br>
  </li>
  <li>To avoid missing some very basic things about what is involved
in
implementing the SortedSet interface, there is a simple test driver
that you can use: Copy ~/../public/P2/SomeP2Checks.java
to your working directory, compile it, and run it. If it compiles and
runs with no problems, then you probably have some of the most basic
things
right about your SkipListSet and TreapSet. If it does not, you should
definitely concentrate on fixing what's wrong. </li>
</ol>
