- avoid using mixed case, verilog case sensitive but other tools are not
- blocking, a = b, assigned immediately, next statment blocked till done
- non blocking, a <= b
- no latches = see one, something wrong
- no combinatorial loops = bad
- c gets b, a gets b
  a = b
  c = a
- c gets old value of a
  a <= b
  c <= a
  - cannot use both at same time
- $stop, $finish, $time, $display... system calls
- register: reg...
- net: wire...
- initial, wait, forever, repeat... not synthesizable
- #x = wait for x nano seconds
- assign = continuous assignment
