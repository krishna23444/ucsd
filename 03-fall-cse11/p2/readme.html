Programming assignment #2:  CSE 11 Fall 2003
</font>
</h2> <hr>

<p>
Here's a description of the second programming assignment for CSE 11,
Fall 2003.  In this assignment, you will design, implement, and
test an Abstract Data Type (ADT) in Java.  Along the
way you'll get experience with the object-oriented programming
concepts of instance methods, instance variables, and
creating and using objects.
</p><p>
&gt;&gt;&gt; Due deadline:  	Wed Oct 15 12:00noon
</p><p>
&gt;&gt;&gt; Required solution files:  Rational.java, TestRational.java
</p><p>

This means that the files that contain your solution to the assignment
must be turned in by the due deadline.  Use
the bundleP2 script to turn in your assignment.
 </p><p> 
It's a good idea to plan to do the
assignment well before the deadline; terminals and
tutors can get very busy at the last minute.  
 </p><p> 
For this and subsequent assignments, you do NOT see a tutor in the
lab to get it graded.  Instead, your turned-in assignment will be
graded by the CSE 11 staff within 10 days after the due deadline, and
your grade will be emailed to your cs11 account.  Some turned-in assignments
will be graded before others are; don't worry if yours isn't graded right
away.  If you turned it in, it will be graded within 10 days after the 
due deadline.
 </p><p> 
In doing this assignment, it's your responsibility to understand the
course rules for integrity of scholarship.
 </p><p> 
</p><h4> 1: Getting started </h4> 
First, read Chapters 4 and 5 of the
textbook.  This assignment uses material introduced and discussed
there.
 <p>
Next, create a directory named "P2" under your cs11 home directory.
Your solution to this assignment should be turned in from that directory
by the due date and time.  Use the bundleP2 script to do that.

 </p><p>
This assignment involves implementing an ADT with a specified user interface.
Be sure you pay special
attention to what is required in terms of the visibility,
name, return type, and number and type of arguments for the public methods of
the class you will be writing.  Those are essential aspects of the interface
you are implementing.

 </p><p>

</p><h4> 2: Rational.java </h4> 
In this assignment, you will implement and test an Abstract Data Type
(ADT) designed to represent rational numbers (i.e. fractions) and some
operations on them.  You will implement the ADT as a Java class named
Rational, and you'll implement a test driver for your class as a public
static main method in a file TestRational.java.  Java doesn't come
with a Rational type, so in creating this "user-defined type"
you will be extending
the Java language, adding functionality it did not already have.

 <p> A Rational object is supposed to represent a rational number,
a concept you are familiar with from elementary mathematics.
Any particular rational number has as its state, or properties,
the values of its numerator and its denominator.  Implement this state
as instance variables of type long (this will permit a Rational object
to be potentially more numerically precise than using
a single 64-bit double variable to represent a fraction).
Follow the usual rules of ADT design and make these variables private.
 </p><p>
As for behavior, or operations that should be part of the public interface
of the Rational ADT:  
 </p><p>
Define 3 public constructors:  a default constructor that initializes the
object to have a numerator of 0 and a denominator of 1; a constructor
that takes one argument of type long, and initializes the numerator
to that value, and the denominator to 1; and a constructor that takes
two arguments of type long, for the initial numerator and denominator
value respectively.  The two-argument constructor should permit
creating a Rational with zero denominator.
 </p><p>
Define public 2 accessor methods: getNumerator() and getDenominator(), that
return (as a long) the "top" (i.e., numerator) and "bottom"
(i.e., denominator) of the Rational
object, respectively.
 </p><p>
Rationals are intuitively a numeric type, so the Rational ADT should
provide operations corresponding to the binary numeric operations
add, subtract, multiply, and divide.  Implement these as public instance
methods with those names, spelled precisely the same.
Each of these methods should take one
argument, a Rational object, and return a new Rational object as a result
of the operation.  So, as an example,
</p><pre>Rational r1 = new Rational(3,4);
Rational r2 = new Rational(1,4);
Rational r3 = r1.subtract(r2);
</pre>
should make r3 point to a Rational object that represents a value
which is equal to 1/2 (for example, a Rational with numerator
8 and denominator 16).  None of these
numeric methods should have any side effects (that is, they should not
print anything, or change anything about the calling or argument
object).
 <p>
Define a public instance method toString(), which takes no argument,
and returns a String precisely representing the contents of the object.
With Rational objects, this means the value of the
numerator, followed by the slash character,
followed by the value of the denominator, with no spaces.
Continuing the above example,
</p><pre>System.out.print(r1.toString())
</pre>
should print 
<pre>3/4
</pre>
(with no spaces).
 <p>
Also define a public instance method toDouble(), taking no argument,
which returns the numerical value of the calling object as a double
(or, at least, as close as can be represented in a double).
 </p><p>
In addition, define a public instance method equals(), which takes
one argument of type Object, and returns boolean true if and
only if the argument
and the calling object are Rationals with the same numeric value.
(They do not have to have the same numerator and denominator!  E.g.
1/2 and 2/4 are equal.)  See the "Hints and other remarks" section
to see how to do this.
 </p><p> Finally, define a public void instance method reduce(), which
takes no argument.  reduce() is the only public method of this ADT
(besides the constructors) that changes anything about the calling
object: it puts the numerator and denominator of the calling object in
"normalized" or "reduced" form.
 </p><p> The normalized or 
reduced form of a fraction is a rational form in which the
numerator and denominator have no common factors greater than 1 (a
common factor is an integer that divides both the numerator and
denominator with remainder zero), and the denominator is nonnegative.
For example, 200/300 in reduced form is 2/3; 81/-36 in reduced form is
-9/4.
 </p><p> This method is algorithmically the most complicated in this
assignment, so it is especially important to think clearly first about
an algorithm that will solve the problem.  Keep in mind the definition
of reduced form, and consider how to eliminate all common factors
greater than 1 from the numerator and denominator of a fraction, while
keeping track of the sign correctly.
 </p><p>
One way to do this (as you probably learned in school) is to make a
list of the prime factors of the numerator and the denominator, and
then "cancel common factors".  However, translating this algorithm
directly into Java requires knowing how to use arrays, lists, or
vectors, and we haven't learned that yet.  It's not a particularly
efficient algorithm, anyway.
 </p><p>
Fortunately, it is not necessary to first create lists of all the factors;
it is only necessary to find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the
numerator and denominator.  (The GCD is equal to the product of all the
common prime factors.)    If the numerator and denominator are
positive, the GCD can't be larger than the smaller of the two, and you
can exhaustively iterate through 
all the possibilities.  (Actually, this approach
isn't terribly efficient, either, and it will take a very long time
to run on some inputs.  You may have learned
somewhere Euclid's algorithm for finding the GCD of two numbers, which
somewhat more efficient yet; you can use it here, but only
if you understand it!)
 </p><p>
Once you come up with an algorithm to find the reduced form of a
fraction, translating it into Java to implement the reduce() method
is not so hard.  (You will find the
while-loop and if-else statements and the modulus operator % useful.)
 </p><p>

</p><h4> 3: TestRational.java </h4> 
Whenever you are implementing an ADT (or writing any software,
actually), you have to test your implementation
to try to make sure it works correctly.  One common practice in Java
is to have a public static void main method in the same class that is
implementing the ADT, which is written to act as a test driver.  
However, in this
assignment, you will put your test driver program in another class,
in a file named TestRational.java.
 <p>
Your test driver should prompt the user for some values to use for
numerators and denominators, and then it should create Rational objects
and call their methods to test them, and print out the results.
TestRational must fully test the Rational class, by creating
Rational objects and calling their instance methods.  The way it
formats its output, reports errors, etc. is up to you,
as long as it permits thoroughly testing all features of the
Rational ADT.  You can cd to
~/../public/P2 and run java -jar P2Solution.jar to see what
acceptable test driver for this assignment might look like when testing a
correct Rational class.  

 </p><h4>Hints and other remarks </h4> 
<ol>
<li> 
Be sure all class and method names are spelled and defined 
exactly as required;
your assignment will be graded in large part by linking to a test driver which
will expect them to be spelled as specified in this README file, with
visibility, 
number and type and ordering of arguments as specified, etc.  If they
aren't, they're wrong.  You should be able to check yourself 
that your solution meets this part
of the interface specification.  However for this assignment we are
also providing an automatic interface checker for you.  To use it,
 you can copy CheckRationalInterface.jar
from the ~/../public/P2 directory to your P2 directory, and run
java -jar CheckRationalInterface.jar.
 <p>
Of course your methods must also work correctly.  This is especially
important for the constructors and accessors, since these must be correct
in order to correctly test the others.
 </p><p> Also note that no Rational method should take keyboard
input, or print anything to the terminal screen.  (Your TestRational
test driver will take keyboard input and print results, but no
Rational method ever should.)  In general, you want an ADT to be as
generally useful as possible; this usually means being able to use it
to do computations even when there is no keyboard or terminal display.
</p><p></p></li><li> 
For each method, think carefully first about the algorithm you'll use for
that method, and only then start writing code.
<p></p></li><li> 
Your numerical methods should be efficient.  It is not necessary
to fully or partially normalize the result of every numeric operation, 
nor is it desirable to do so, because it may appreciably slow the operation.
<p></p></li><li> 
The equals() method must be declared to take one argument, of type
Object.  Why should it do that, instead of taking an argument of type
Rational?  The reason has to do with class derivation and inheritance, and
will be explained in detail later in the course.  However, it's not too
early to get in the habit of defining this kind of equals() method for your
classes.  
 <p>
Since the formal parameter to the equals method is of type Object, an
instance of <i>any</i> class (but not any primitive type) 
can be passed as actual argument; and also
the null pointer <code>null</code> can be passed.  We can consider these cases:
 </p><p> a.  If a null pointer is passed, equals() should return false (a
Rational can never be equal to null).  Java's <code>==</code> comparison
operator is useful for checking this.
 </p><p> b.  If something other than a Rational object is passed as
argument, equals() should return false (a Rational object can never be equal
to something that is not even a Rational object).  Java's 
<code>instanceof</code> operator is useful for checking this.
 </p><p> c.  Otherwise, the equals() method should access the instance variables
of the calling object and the argument object, and return true or false
as appropriate.  However, the formal parameter needs to be cast to type
Rational, before the numerator and denominator instance variables can
be accessed. 
 </p><p>
So, your equals method can have a form something like this:
</p><pre>public boolean equals(Object other) {
	if (other == null) return false;
	if (! (other instanceof Rational) ) return false;
	Rational rother = (Rational) other; 
	// now check if this object has same "state" as rother...

}
</pre>

<p></p></li><li> 
You may define as many private instance methods ("helper
functions") in the Rational class as you want, if your "top-down"
design suggests you should.  However, you shouldn't provide any
public methods other than the ones required by the specification
given above.
<p></p></li><li> 
You should allow Rationals with zero denominator to be
created, and toString() and the accessor methods should work correctly
with such Rationals.  However, the results of using a zero-denominator
Rational in a numerical operation, or the result of reducing it, are
undefined (as is the result of dividing by a Rational that has zero
numerator).  That means that any kind of runtime error can happen in
these cases, or any value may be returned.  You
shouldn't do anything to prevent this in your Rational methods; it will
be up to the user of the Rational class to avoid these cases, or to
handle whatever happens in a way that the user decides is appropriate.
<p></p></li><li> 
On this assignment, you will lose points if your code is
poorly commented or otherwise uses bad style.  The style and
commenting guidelines in Chapter 2 of the textbook are good ones to follow.  In
addition, make sure your lines of code are shorter than 80 characters
(longer statements should be nicely broken with linebreaks, 
or should be re-written as
a sequence of shorter statements), and make sure no extra control
characters (e.g., ^M's) appear in your source code files as the result
of binary file transfers from incompatible operating systems.
</li></ol>


 <h4>
Grading of assignment # 2
 </h4> 

There are 20 possible points for this assignment:
<pre>a.   3 points for the 3 constructors  (these need to be correct to test the others!)

b.   2 points for the 2 accessor functions  (likewise!)  

c.   4 points for the 4 numerical methods

d.   one point each for the equals, toString, and toDouble methods

e.   4 points for the normalization method

f.   4 points for the test driver


</pre>

In each case, doing a part of the assignment requires that your program
compiles, runs correctly, is well-written and commented.
