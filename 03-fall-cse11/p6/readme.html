Programming assignment #6:  CSE 11 Fall 2003
</FONT>
</H2> <HR>

<P>
Here's a description of the sixth programming assignment for CSE 11,
Fall 2003.  In this assignment, you will get more experience with 
class derivation in Java as you extend a GUI "artificial
life" simulation to explore how pairs of simple creatures interact
with each other.
<P>
>>> Due deadline:  	Friday Nov 14 5:00pm
<P>
>>> Required solution files:  Chaser.java Random.java Runner.java Custom.java
<P>

This means that the files that contain your solution to the assignment
must be turned in by the due deadline.  Use
the bundleP6 script to turn in your assignment.
 <P> 
It's a good idea to plan to do the
assignment well before the deadline; terminals and
tutors can get very busy at the last minute.  
 <P> 
In doing this assignment, it's your responsibility to understand the
course rules for integrity of scholarship.
 <P> 
<H4> 1: Getting started </H4> 

First, make sure you've read 
Chapter 12 of Savitch.  This assignment uses material and discussed
there.
Next, create a directory named "P6" under your cs11 home directory.
Your solution to this assignment should be turned in from that directory
by the due date and time.  Use the bundleP6 script to do that.
 <P>
Then, copy the following files from the directory ~/../public/P6 to your P6
working directory:
<PRE>
CreatureWorld.java
Creature.java
</PRE>
You will use these classes (but not modify them) in developing your solution.

<H4> PROGRAM SPECIFICATIONS: CreatureWorld.java </H4> 

This program exhibits the behavior of 4 types of "creatures" as
they interact with each other in a world consisting of a region
on your terminal screen.  It can be thought of as a simple
"artificial life" simulation of the interaction of these creatures
in their small world.  To keep it simple, the interaction between 
the creatures is restricted in a way that is described below.
Although the creature's movements are simple, the result of their
interaction can be surprising in various ways.
Each creature is implemented
as a Java object, and so it is an instance of some Java class.
 <P>
There is a base class Creature, with source code in Creature.java.
Four classes derived from Creature shall be as follows:
 <P> a.  The "Chaser" class.  A Chaser tries to catch other creatures.
When it gets a chance to interact with another Creature, a Chaser
moves to a location which, of all its neighboring locations in its
world, is nearest to the other creature.  A Chaser creature appears
on the screen as a red filled circle 15 pixels in diameter, with its
center at the Chaser's location.
 <P> b.  The "Runner" class.  A Runner tries to escape from other
creatures.  In each interaction with another creature, a Runner moves
to a location which, of all its neighboring locations, is farthest
from the other creature.  A Runner creature appears on the screen as a
green filled square 15 pixels on a side, with its center at the
Runner's location.
 <P> c.  The "Random" class.  A Random doesn't care about other
creatures.  When it gets a chance to interact with another
creature, a Random creature moves to a randomly
selected location, no matter where the other creature is.
The new location must be no more than 20 pixels horizontally and 
20 pixels vertically
of its previous location.  A
Random creature appears on the screen as a blue 'X', with the center
of the X at the Random's location.  The 'X' should be 15 pixels high
and 15 pixels wide.
 <P> d.  The "Custom" class.  Here you get to use your imagination.  A
Custom creature can respond to the other creature in any way you like,
as long as the way it does this is different from what the other 3
types of creature do, and as long as it does <I>something</I>.  In
addition, it can display itself in any way you like, as long as it is
different from the other 3 types, and as long as it displays visibly,
at its current location.  Within these constraints, anything is fine,
so have fun.
 <P> In any case, no creature (even a Custom one)
should ever move outside the boundaries of the
"world"; when it gets to an edge, it should move as best it can within
the constraints of the boundary.  (This must be true even if the
Creature it is reacting to is somehow outside the boundary!)
 <P>
When the program runs, the user is given the opportunity to select
the types of Creature to observe, their initial location, and how
many steps to run the simulation.  To exit the simulation, the user
can close the application window.

<H4> Doing the assignment </H4>
0.  You don't write CreatureWorld or Creature; they are already done.
You do have to write, and turn in, source files for the
derived classes Chaser, Runner, Random, and Custom.  The CreatureWorld
application won't compile without these present; so for initial testing,
you can create these as "stub classes", with stub methods that don't
do anything.
 <P> 1.  Look at the source code for the base class in Creature.java.
If your derived classes do not introduce instance variables, the base
class constructor may handle all of the initialization you need; but
since constructors are not inherited, you have to define your own in
the derived classes.  The constructor must take one argument of
type java.awt.Point, which specifies  the
initial location of the Creature.
 <P>
You must override the reactTo() and paint() methods to do the
appropriate thing for each derived class; the ones in the
base class are abstract, and don't provide method bodies at all!  
(Note also that the base class instance variables
have protected visibility, so they are directly accessible within methods
of derived classes.)  These methods will be called from the
CreatureWorld application, after the user clicks the START button
to begin the simulation.
The basic animulation loop in CreatureWorld
looks like this (some pseudocode here):
<PRE>
    // loop for the right number of animation steps
    for(int step = 1; step<=steps; step++) {

      // get a Rectangle specifying the size of the "world"
      Rectangle r = Rectangle_For(world);

      // react each pair of Creatures in order of their indices
      int nCreatures = Number_Of_Creatures();
      for(int ic1 = 0; ic1 < nCreatures; ic1++) {
	for(int ic2 = 0; ic2 < nCreatures; ic2++) {
	  // make Creature indexed ic1 move in reaction to
	  // creature indexed ic2; but don't bother if ic1 == ic2
	  if (ic1 == ic2) continue;
          Creature c1 = Creature_Indexed(ic1);
	  Creature c2 = Creature_Indexed(ic2);
	  c1.reactTo(c2,r);
	}
      }

      // display the Creatures at their new location
      Graphics g = Graphics_For(world);	
      for(int ic = 0; ic < nCreatures; ic++) {
        Creature c1 = Creature_Indexed(ic);
	c1.paint(g);
      }
    }

</PRE>
Since Java does dynamic method binding of public instance method
calls, the <CODE>reactTo()</CODE> 
and <CODE>paint()</CODE> calls will "do the right thing"
corresponding to the actual type of the Creatures pointed to...
once you define the methods appropriately in the subclasses.
 <P> Note that doubly-nested for loop.  When the user adds a Creature
to the world, it is put in an indexed data structure.  The first
creature added has index 0, the second one added has index 1, etc.
The loop structure ensures that each Creature gets to reactTo() every
other one before the result of each animation step is displayed;
but the order in which these reactions take place depends
on the order in which the Creatures were added, and different behaviors
can happen as a result.  If there are more than 2 Creatures involved, 
their interactions can be hard to predict (that's why simulations are
useful).
 <P>
2. To implement the paint() method, note that a java.awt.Graphics 
object is passed
as argument.  The Graphics class defines lots of instance methods for
doing graphics.  See the online Java API documentation for a complete
list.  Here are prototypes for some of the methods you may find useful:
<PRE>
public void drawLine(int x1, int y1, int x2, int y2);
public void drawOval(int x, int y, int width, int height);
public void drawRect(int x, int y, int width, int height);
public void drawString(String str, int x, int y);
public void fillOval(int x, int y, int width, int height);
public void fillRect(int x, int y, int width, int height);
public void setColor(Color c);
</PRE>
Note that the x,y location for rectangles and ovals is the upper left
"corner" of the rectangle or oval.  To get one of these figures to
display centered at a certain location, you will have to add an 
appropriate offset to the location.
 <P>
3.  The reactTo() method takes two arguments: a Creature to react to,
and a Rectangle that specifies the limits of allowed movement.  The
Creature must not move outside that Rectangle.  Rectangle
is a class in the java.awt package.  It is a somewhat unusual class, in
that its instance variables are public :
<PRE>
 public int x; // The x coordinate of the upper left corner of the rectangle.
 public int y; // The y coordinate of the rectangle.
 public int width; // The width of the rectangle.
 public int height; // The height of the rectangle.
</PRE>
Rectangle also defines many instance methods.  One you may find useful has this prototype:
<PRE>
//Checks whether this rectangle contains the specified Point
public boolean contains(Point p) 
</PRE>
You should note that the Point class, also in the java.awt package, has public
instance variables as well.  See the online documentation of the Java
standard library classes for more information.

 <P>
One interesting part of the assignment is coming up with
an algorithm for finding a "best" position for a Chaser or a Runner
creature to move to, when it reacts to another creature.  Here's a
hint for one possible way to do this.  A creature has a certain x,y location on
the "world Canvas".  The neighboring locations are the 9 pixels with
coordinates

<PRE>
	x-1,y-1   x,y-1   x+1,y-1


	x-1,y     x,y     x+1,y


	x-1,y+1   x,y+1   x+1,y+1
</PRE>

So, all combinations of offsets from the current x and y coordinates
can be tried with a doubly-nested for loop.
You can pick the one that is "best" according to whether
the creature wants to be closer or farther from the location of the
other creature (remember to stay within the boundaries of the Rectangle
passed to the reactTo() method).
 <P> 4. An object of the Random class moves randomly.  How to do that?
You can use the random number generator method random(), which is
public static in the Math class.  Math.random() takes no arguments,
and returns a double uniformly distributed in the range 0.0 up to (but
not including) 1.0.  You can scale and shift this number to lie in the
range [-20,20]; then adding one such random number to the current x
coordinate and another to the y coordinate of a Random creature makes
it move randomly, but not too far from its previous location.  (As
with all Creatures, be sure to keep it from moving out of the
"world".)  It can be amusing to watch a Chaser try to catch a Random!
 <P> 5.  If you're wondering how everything should
work (except for the Custom class), you can run 
the P6Solution.jar application jarfile found in the public/P6 directory.
 <P> 6.  This assignment involves dealing with a GUI application; it
cannot be run over telnet.  It can be run over the network and
displayed on your local machine if you have an X server on your
machine (which you will have for free if you're running Linux or
FreeBSD; X servers are also available for Windows and MacOS).
Otherwise go to the lab to run your solution for this assignment in
the context of the CreatureWorld application.  (But note also that you
can test the requirements of the reactTo() methods without using a GUI
at all.)
 <P> 7.  Look at and learn from the main() method in
CreatureWorld.java.  That is typical, for an event-driven GUI
application.
 <H4>
Grading of assignment # 6
 </H4> 

There are 20 possible points for this assignment, broken down as follows:
<PRE>
a.   5 points for your Chaser class
b.   5 points for your Runner class
c.   5 points for your Random class
d.   5 points for your Custom class


</PRE>

In each case, doing a part of the assignment means that your code
compiles, runs correctly, satisfies the specifications,
is well-written and commented.
