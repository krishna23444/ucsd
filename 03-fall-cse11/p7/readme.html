Programming assignment #7 README:  CSE 11 Fall 2003
</font>
</h2> <hr>

<p>
Here's a description of the seventh programming assignment for CSE 11,
Fall 2003.  In this assignment, you will use arrays and event-driven
progamming to create a GUI application running a cellular automaton
simulation.
</p><p>
&gt;&gt;&gt; Due deadline:  Friday Nov 21 5:00pm
</p><p>
&gt;&gt;&gt; Required solution files:  Life.java 
</p><p>

This means that the file that contains your solution to the assignment
must be turned in by the due deadline.   Use
the bundleP7 script to turn in your assignment.
 </p><p> 
It's a good idea to plan to do the
assignment well before the deadline; terminals and
tutors can get very busy at the last minute.  
In doing this assignment, it's your responsibility to understand the
course rules for integrity of scholarship.
 </p><p> 
</p><h4> Getting started </h4> 
First, make sure you've read chapters 6, 12, and parts of chapter 14 of the
textbook.  This assignment uses material introduced and discussed
there.
Next, create a directory named "P7" under your cs11 home directory.
Your solution to this assignment should be turned in from that directory
by the due date and time.  Use the bundleP7 script to do that.

 <p> This assignment involves implementing Java classes with a
specified user interface.  Be sure you pay attention to what is
required in terms of the name, return type, and number and type of
arguments for the public methods of the class you will be writing.
 </p><p>
</p><h4> PROGRAM SPECIFICATIONS: Life.java </h4> 

This program implements a general "Game of Life", a
"cellular automaton" world consisting of a rectangular array of cells,
each of which is either Alive or Dead.  The world starts in an initial
state (i.e. a pattern of Alive and Dead cells), and then moves
through a series of successive states.  Each state is called a
<i>generation</i>.  State-transition rules determine the way
the pattern of Alive/Dead cells change from one generation to the next.
There are 4 transition possibilities for a cell:
<pre>Dead -&gt; Dead:   "stasis"
Dead -&gt; Alive:  "birth"
Alive -&gt; Alive: "survival"
Alive -&gt; Dead:  "death"
</pre>
The fate of a cell in going from one generation to the next depends on
whether it is Alive or Dead in the current generation, and on the number of 
Alive neighbors it has in the current generation.
Different state-transition rules lead to different "Games of Life"
with worlds that evolve in different ways.  
A particularly interesting state transition
rule discovered by the mathematician John Horton Conway is this:
A "birth" happens only with 3 Alive neighbors, "survival" happens
only with 2 or 3 Alive neighbors, and "stasis" or "death" happens
otherwise.  This Conway Rule leads to many interesting patterns
developing in the game.
 <p>
A neighbor of a cell is defined as one of its 8 adjacent cells 
(upper left, above, upper right, left, right, lower left, below, lower right),
so a cell can have at most 8 Alive neighbors.
For this assignment, the world is a finite rectangle with a certain number
of rows and columns, and there are no Alive cells outside the world.
 </p><p>
The program shall be run as follows:
</p><pre>java Life &lt;FILENAME&gt;
</pre>
The initial state of the world is read from the file whose
name is given as the first command line argument
(format specified below) A window is created, which contains
these components:
<ol>
<li> 
A central panel, which displays the initial state of the world,
and subsequent generations, in a form described below.
The user can change the state of the world by clicking the
mouse in a displayed cell. Doing so changes the state of that
cell (to Alive it was Dead, or to Dead if it was Alive).  The
result of such a change is displayed.
</li><li> 
A text field, initialized to "10",
in which the user can enter a nonnegative integer which is the
number of successive generations to compute and display.
This text field should have a label associated with it, that indicates
to the user that it represents the number of generations.
</li><li> 
A button
labeled "Start", which when pushed computes and displays
as many subsequent
generations as are indicated by the number in the text
field, at a rate of approximately two per second.  
</li><li> 
An output label that displays a running count
of the number of generations displayed, and error messages
as appropriate.
</li></ol>
 <p>
<b>File format</b>:  The initial state of the world will be read from a
file.  This file is a binary file, with format as 
follows: <br>
The first 4 bytes of the file are an int, indicating the number of
rows in the world, R.  The next 4 bytes in the file are another int,
indicating the number of columns in the world, C.  Then there follow
R*C bytes. The first C bytes specify the states of the cells in
the top row of the world, left to right; and so on.  A byte that
is equal to 0 indicates a Dead cell; a nonzero byte indicates a
Alive cell.  If there are more bytes in the file than required by the
world size,
the extra ones are to be ignored.  If there are fewer bytes in the file
than required by the world size, the unspecified cells are assumed to be Dead.

 </p><p> <b>Display format</b>: When run, the Life program first reads a
world state specification file, as described above.  It displays this
world in a central panel in the application window, and permits the
user to change the state of some cells by clicking on them.  Each cell
in the world should be displayed on the central panel
as a filled circle 10 pixels in
diameter, and the central panel should be the exact size required to
display all cells in the world.  The panel
background, Alive cells, and Dead cells should be displayed in
contrasting colors so they can be distinguished from each other.
 </p><p>
When the user clicks the start
button, new generations are computed and displayed.  The application
pauses after the required generations have been displayed, permitting
the user to continue if they want to, or to exit the application
by clicking on the "close window" button provided by the window
system.
 </p><p>
</p><h4> CLASS INTERFACE SPECIFICATIONS: Life.java </h4> 
The Life class should be defined to extend JFrame.  An instance
of the Life class will correspond to the top-level application
window for your program.  
 <p>
You must define this protected instance variable in your class:
</p><pre> protected boolean[][] world;  
</pre>
The elements of the world array represent the states of
cells in an instance of the game of Life.  Each cell 
is in one of two states (Alive or Dead), so a boolean array 
is appropriate.  The number of rows and columns of this
two-dimensional array must be exactly the same as the number of
rows and columns in
this instance of Life.  (And note that it must have protected
visibility, so subclasses can access it as needed.)
 <p>
You must define at least these public methods in your Life class:
</p><pre>/** Constructor:  initialize a new Life object to represent
 *  a world with the given number of rows and columns of cells.
 *  All cells are initially Dead.  This constructor also creates
 *  appropriate components and containers and adds them to the
 *  application container, and creates and registers appropriate
 *  listener objects.  It does not make any GUI objects visible.
 */
public Life(int rows, int cols) 
</pre>
<pre>/** Read a world initial state specification file (format described
 *  in the P7 README) with name given by its argument.  
 *  Create and return a Life object whose world is in the state specified 
 *  by the file.
 *  @throws java.io.IOException containing an appropriate message if
 *  the file is badly formatted or unreadable, or if an I/O error occurs.
 */
public static Life fromFile(String filename)
		throws IOException
</pre>
<pre>/** Update the state of the protected boolean[][] world array of
 * this Life object (i.e., compute the next generation) according
 * to the Conway state-transition rule.
 * This method does not do any displaying.
 */
public void next() 
</pre>
<pre>/** The entry point for the Life program.  
 *  Creates a Life object initialized from the file given as
 *  the first command line argument, and makes it visible.
 */
public static void main(String args[])
</pre>
You may define any other private static or instance methods or 
variables, or inner classes that you wish.
<h4> Hints and other observations </h4> 
 <p>
1. One major part of the assignment is implementing the next() method.
It is quite hard to compute the state of the next generation using only the
world array that is representing the current generation; so we suggest you
create another array to hold the new generation while you are computing
it, and then make the world array pointer point to it when done.  But
be careful; when next() returns, the protected world variable must point to
the new generation.
 </p><p>
2. To compute a new generation, apply the rule of the game to each cell.
Be sure to take into account that the world "ends" at its edges,
as mentioned above.
In thinking about how to decompose the problem into manageable
pieces, you may find that methods with suggestive names like 
countLiveNeighbors(int row, int col) and isAlive(int row, int col)
might be useful.
 </p><p>
4. Each cell takes up a circle 10 pixels in diameter when displayed.
Therefore, if your world has R rows and C columns, your central
panel must have width 10*C and height 10*R pixels to display the world.  The
application JFrame needs to be large enough to hold such a central
panel, the start button, the text field, the two required labels, plus
any default borders and decorations belonging to the JFrame.
A trick of JFC/AWT programming to accomplish this is to use a
JPanel for the central panel, call the setPreferredSize() method of
the JPanel to set its size, and after adding it and all other needed
components to the JFrame's content pane, to
"pack" the JFrame.  Note that setPreferredSize() takes one argument,
of type Dimension.  Some code in your Life constructor can look something 
like this:
</p><pre>	Container c = this.getContentPane();
	JPanel p = new JPanel();
	p.setPreferredSize(new Dimension(10*C,10*R));
	c.add(p);
	this.pack();
</pre>
The pack() method computes the right size for the JFrame to be
able to contain its Components, so you don't have to.
 <p>
5. Note that the only file you will turn in is Life.java.  However,
you will want to define several new classes, with methods that override
versions in base classes.  So inner classes will be necessary, and
in particular anonymous inner classes will be appropriate for this
assignment.  You should consider these:
 </p><p>
a.  An anonymous inner class that extends JPanel and that overrides
the paintComponent(Graphics g) method to display the current world state
in the JPanel.   This method should first call
super.paintComponent(g) to clear the background and produce a
better-looking animation.   An instance of this class will be the central panel
in the application window.
 </p><p>
b.  An anonymous inner class that extends MouseAdapter and that overrides
mouseClicked() to handle the mouse click events fired by the central
JPanel.  An instance of this class will be registered as a MouseEvent
listener with the central JPanel.  The handler method needs to determine
the x,y coordinates of the mouse click, to change
the state of the clicked cell appropriately, and to display the new
state.  To display the new state, you can
just call the repaint() method of the JPanel,
which takes care of calling its paintComponent() method.
 </p><p>
c.  An anonymous inner class that implements ActionListener and that
overrides actionPerformed() to handle the start button being clicked.
An instance of this class will be registered as an ActionEvent
listener with the start button.  The handler method needs to get the
text in the text field, convert it to an int, and run the game of life
for that many generations (not counting the current generation),
causing each generation to be displayed in the central JPanel.  If the
contents of the text field are not parseable as a positive int, an
error should be displayed in the output label.  As each generation is
displayed, the number of that generation should be displayed in the
output label.
 </p><p>
d.  An anonymous inner class that extends WindowAdapter and that overrides
windowClosing() to exit the application.  
An instance of this class will be registered as a WindowEvent listener
with the overall JFrame.  Alternatively, you could just 
setDefaultCloseOperation to JFrame.EXIT_ON_CLOSE.
 </p><p> 
6. To cause a container to display all of its components, you normally
call the container's repaint() method.  However, for animations such as
the Life program, that may not work as you would hope; in an attempt
to be efficient, the runtime system
can "coalesce" multiple calls to paint() into one call, and you won't
see anything but the last frame in the animation.  Instead, it is
better in animations to call the paintImmediately() method of the 
container, which does not do this coalescing.  Note that 
paintImmediately() takes 4 int arguments which specify the rectangular area
in the container to paint immediately:
</p><pre>paintImmediately(int x, int y, int width, int height)
</pre>
You should think about calling paintImmediately for two purposes:
 <p>
a.  In the event handler for the start button, after a new generation has
been computed, call the paintImmediately() method of the central
JPanel.  (This leads to its overrided paintComponent() method being
called.)  If the JPanel is p, painting the entire JPanel immediately
can be done with a call like
</p><pre>p.paintImmediately(0,0,p.getWidth(),p.getHeight());
</pre>
 <p>
b.  In the event handler for the start button, after a new generation has
been computed, you will update the text in the output label.  To make
this new text appear immediately, call the paintImmediately() method
for that label's container.  For convenience, you may want to place that
label in a JPanel container, and place that JPanel in a region of
the top-level JFrame.
 </p><p> 
7. As for things like displaying filled circles at the appropriate
places, refer to some of the previous programming
assignments!
 </p><p>
As for sleeping your program 
between generations:  
Call the static <code>sleep()</code>
method of the <code>Thread</code> class to pause your
program for a desired length of time.  
The <code>Thread.sleep()</code>
method takes an argument of type <code>long</code>, which is the
number of milliseconds for your program to sleep.  One complication
is that this method can throw an exception which must be caught or
rethrown.  
Another complication is that this technique is not a particularly 
accurate way to mark time, especially if the machine is heavily
loaded.  But it is accurate enough for this assignment.

 </p><p>
8. Some Life world specification files are available
in the public/P7 directory which you can use.  These are text files, so
they can be viewed and modified in a text editor if you want, and of
course you can create your own:
</p><pre>

blank:		A 15 row, 22 column world with all cells Dead.  

full:		A 15 row, 22 column world with all cells Alive.  

explode:  	A pattern which "explodes" and reaches a stable state after 
		about 65 generations

glider1:	A pattern which reproduces itself at nearby locations,
		walking or "gliding" diagonally up the screen

hithere:	A pattern of letters which evolves in an interesting way

oscillate:	A pattern which expands for awhile, and then oscillates 
		forever with a period of 2 generations

random:		Random initial conditions which evolve in a complicated way

stable:		A pattern which doesn't change

</pre>
Also, the file P7Solution.jar in that directory is a working solution to
the assignment.
