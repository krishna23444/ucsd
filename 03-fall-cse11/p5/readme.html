</h2> <hr>

<p>
Here's a description of the fifth programming assignment for CSE 11,
Fall 2003.  In this assignment, you will write a "compiler" for a 
simple programming language.  Along the way you will get experience
with text file I/O and exception handling in Java.
</p><p>
&gt;&gt;&gt; Due deadline:  	Friday Nov 7 5:00pm
</p><p>
&gt;&gt;&gt; Required solution files:  aguac.java SyntaxError.java
</p><p>

This means that the files that contain your solution to the assignment
must be turned in by the due deadline.    Use
the bundleP5 script to turn in your assignment.
 </p><p> 
It's a good idea to plan to do the
assignment well before the deadline; terminals and
tutors can get very busy at the last minute.  
In doing this assignment, it's your responsibility to understand the
course rules for integrity of scholarship.
 </p><p> 
</p><h4> Getting started </h4> 
First, make sure you've read chapters 8 and 9 of the
textbook.  This assignment uses material introduced and discussed
there.
 <p>
Next, create a directory named "P5" under your cs11 home directory.
Your solution to this assignment should be turned in from that directory
by the due date and time.  Use the bundleP5 script to do that.

 </p><p>
</p><h4> PROGRAM SPECIFICATIONS: aguac.java </h4> 

As a computer scientist, you realize that many people find
learning Java to be time-consuming and difficult.  So we have designed
a simpler high-level language, Agua, which is easy to learn.  (It is called
"Agua" because it is a lot weaker than Java.)  Here is
an example of an Agua program:
<pre> READ 4 NUMBERS
 WRITE THE SUM
</pre>


That's it; no class definitions, let alone methods, variables, or conditional
statements.  Agua is easy to understand, too.  That program, when
run, prompts the user for 4 numbers typed at the terminal keyboard,
and after those numbers are entered, it then prints out their sum to
the terminal screen.
 <p>
Here's another Agua program:
</p><pre> READ 20 NUMBERS
 WRITE THE AVERAGE
 WRITE THE SUM
 READ 3 NUMBERS
 WRITE THE PRODUCT
 WRITE THE STANDARD DEVIATION
</pre>


When run, this program prompts the user for 20 numbers, and then
prints out the average and sum of those numbers.  Then it prompts the
user for 3 more numbers, and prints the product and standard
deviation of those 3 numbers.
 <p>
So, Agua statements have a very simple syntax.  They can be of only 2
types:  "input" statements, of the form
</p><pre>	READ &lt;N&gt; NUMBERS
</pre>
where <tt>&lt;N&gt;</tt> 
is a positive integer literal, and "output" statements of the form
<pre>	WRITE THE &lt;OP&gt;
</pre>

where <tt>&lt;OP&gt;</tt> is one of SUM, AVERAGE, PRODUCT, or STANDARD
DEVIATION.  So, there are
always exactly 3 or 4 whitespace-delimited tokens in an Agua
statement. There can be any amount of whitespace (space or tab characters)
between the
tokens in a statement, but every statement needs to be on its own line.
There can be any number of whitespace-only lines between
statements.  (It follows from these syntax rules that every line
in an Agua source code file has either 0, 3, or 4 tokens.  If
it has 3 or 4 tokens, the first
token is either READ or WRITE; if the first token is WRITE, the second
must be THE; etc., etc.  Anything that violates any of the
syntax rules is a syntax error.)
 <p>
And the semantics of Agua statements are also simple.  An "input"
statement  prompts the user
for the given number of numbers, and reads
them in.  The user must enter exactly that many numbers, one per line, 
as well-formatted integer or floating literal
constants.  For example, the input statement "READ 47 NUMBERS" means that
the Agua program must output
"ENTER 47 NUMBERS, ONE PER LINE:", and then read 47 lines of
input, each with a number entered on it.
 </p><p>
An "output" statement describes and
prints out the result of the specified
operation SUM, AVERAGE,  PRODUCT, or STANDARD DEVIATION
performed on the set of numbers read in by the most recent "input"
statement.  For example, the output statement
"WRITE THE AVERAGE" means that the Agua program must output
"THE AVERAGE IS:", followed on the same line by the average of
the numbers entered.
(If a "output" statement occurs before any "input"
statements, that is syntactically legal Agua, but the semantics are
undefined.)
 </p><p> But for Agua to be at all useful, there must be an Agua compiler
to translate Agua programs into a form that a computer can understand.  That is
the goal of this programming assignment.  The compilation of Agua
programs will take two steps: First the Java program you write will
translate an Agua program into a Java program that has the same
semantics as the Agua program (that is, YOUR Java program will write
another Java program!).  Then someone can use javac to compile that
Java program to create a Java bytecode .class file that can be run.
When it is run, it will read in numbers from the keyboard and print
results to the console window, according to the semantics of the
Agua program.
 </p><p>
In a file aguac.java in your P5 directory, write a public static
void main method that
will satisfy these specifications:
</p><blockquote>
  The program shall be useful as an Agua compiler.  When run, it
  uses the first command line argument as the name
  of an Agua source code file in the current working directory.
  The file name must end with a ".agua" extension; if it doesn't,
  the program will print an error message and exit.
  If the file contains syntactically correct Agua code,
  it translates it into a Java program, putting the Java code in a file
  with the same name as the Agua source file, but with a ".java" extension.
  If there is a syntax error in the Agua source file, a message describing
  the first error in the file, and its line number in the file, should
  be printed to standard output, and the program should exit.
</blockquote>

<h4> How to do this assignment </h4> 
In solving this assignment, adopt the procedural programming paradigm.
Define only static methods in the aguac class.  (You may also want
to use some private static variables.)
Top-down design and stepwise refinement are
powerful software development techniques that you should use for
this assignment.  Your program will be a command line, text-only,
console program.
 <p> A.  First, think about how to procedurally decompose the overall
problem.  One decomposition is this: (1) Check to make sure that the Agua
source file name is of the form &lt;SOMETHING&gt;.agua; (2) Create a
BufferedReader object to read from that file; (3) Create a PrintWriter
object to write to the file &lt;SOMETHING&gt;.java; (4) Translate from
the .agua file to the .java file; (5) Close the PrintWriter.  In the
procedural programming paradigm, you would write a private static
method to solve each of these parts of the problem, and call them from
your main method.
 </p><p> All of these methods are quite simple to write, except (4).  So,
complete all of them at this stage except for that one.  You should
initially write your "doTranslation" method (it does not need to be called
that) as a stub that just copies
the Agua program in the file associated with the BufferedReader to the
file associated with the PrintWriter, without yet doing any
translation into Java.  This will let you test your program at an
initial "coarse" level of refinement.
 </p><p> B.  For the next level of refinement, notice that step (4) above,
translating from the .agua file to the .java file, can itself be
broken down into substeps: (4a) outputting a beginning part of a Java
source code file that will be common to all translations from Agua; (4b)
translating the particular Agua program to Java statements; and (4c)
outputting an ending part of Java code that will be common to all Agua
translations.  Here again, all 3 steps can be handled by 
defining, and using static methods.  Steps (4a) and (4c) should be coded
and tested completely at this level of refinement, because they
are quite simple.  (4b) should be
written now as a stub, which just copies the Agua file to the Java file,
with each line preceded by a '//' to turn it into a comment.  
Now, because of (4a) and (4c), the output .java file will
contain real Java code, and will compile with javac (though the result won't
do anything).
 </p><p> C.  For the next level of refinement, decompose step (4b) above into
subparts.  Here there are two types of Agua statement to process, and
correspondingly two kinds of Java code to output in response.  (Also,
to satisfy the specifications, you have to detect whether there is any
syntax error in the Agua code.  You don't have to find all the errors, if
there is more than one.  Your program can exit as soon as it finds and
reports the first one.)  Code to handle each of these types of
statement should be encapsulated in methods as well.
 </p><p>
With the job of translating Agua to Java spread out over several methods,
it will be a win to use the exception-handling mechanisms of Java.  Define
a class SyntaxError which extends Exception.  Define a constructor for this
class
that takes a String message.  (You may also define other methods
if you want.)  When one of your methods
detects an Agua syntax error in the source file, it should create and throw
a SyntaxError object.  These should be caught in only one place (i.e.
you should have ONLY ONE "catch (SyntaxError e)" in your entire aguac.java
file.)  For full credit on this part of the assignment, you should report
the line number of the .agua file on which the syntax error was detected.
If there is more than one syntax error in the .agua file,
only the first one needs to be detected.
 </p><p>
Now, when you run your program as, for example,
</p><pre>java aguac prog1.agua
</pre>
if prog1.agua contains no syntax errors, it should
produce a file prog1.java of Java code.  Inspect this file to see that it
appears to be correct Java.  You should compile it with javac and run
it to see if it really works as it's supposed to.
<h4> Hints and other observations </h4> 
 <p>
0.  To be clear about the definition of "average" and "standard deviation":
The average of a set of numbers is defined as the sum of the numbers
in the set,
divided by the number of numbers in the set.
The standard deviation of a set of numbers is defined as the square root
of the variance of the numbers; 
the variance of a set of numbers is defined as the difference 
between the average of the squares of the numbers and
the square of the average of the numbers.
(Standard deviation is a widely used statistical measure of how much
a set of numbers 
are spread out around their average;  a small standard deviation
means the numbers are tightly grouped around their average.)

 </p><p>
1.
In your main method header
</p><pre>public static void main (String[] args) {
</pre>
<code>args</code> is an array of Strings. These are the arguments passed
on the command line when the program is run by the java interpreter.
So, the first command-line argument can be referred to as
<pre>      args[0]
</pre>
which is a String.
 <p>
2.  When you open a .java file for output from your compiler, this will
probably erase any existing file with that name in your current directory.
Be careful.  For example, running <code>java aguac aguac.agua</code> 
might be very bad for you.
 </p><p> 3.  To output a correct Java translation of Agua code, you have
to think a bit.  Use your knowledge of Java.  (But it is really not
all that hard.  If you think you have to use arrays, you are thinking
of a solution that is harder than it needs to be!)  A hint is  that since when
you are translating an "input" statment you do not know how what
"output" statments will follow, you may have to precompute what any
"output" statement will require.
 </p><p>
4. 
Remember that to put a double quote " in a string literal, precede it
with a backslash: <tt> \" </tt>.  For example, the statement 
</p><pre>System.out.println("He said \"wow\"");
</pre>
prints out
<pre>He said "wow"
</pre>
 <p> 
5.  You may find that the StringTokenizer class in the java.util
package will be handy for this assignment.  
 </p><p> 
6.
The file P5Solution.jar in ~/../public/P5/
meet the specifications of
this assignment.  If you have questions about what is required,
it might be useful to run java -jar P5Solution.jar, passing it as argument
the name of an Agua file to compile.
Files prog1.agua and prog2.agua in that directory contain syntactically
correct Agua programs you can use as examples in testing.  The files prog3.agua
through prog7.agua contain syntax errors.  prog8.agua is a syntactically
correct program (though its semantics are undefined, so the resulting
translation may not do anything useful).
 </p><p> 
7.
You can assume there will be a copy of SavitchIn.class in the directory
where your Java translations of Agua programs run.  Note that 
SavitchIn.readLineDouble() can read either integer literals or
floating literals.

 </p><h4>
3.  Grading of assignment # 5
 </h4>
There are 20 possible points for this assignment.  Your assignment will
be tested on a number of Agua source code files (including the 8 .agua files
in the public directory).  Your score will be based on how many of
them your solution works correctly on.

To get full credit, the files you turn in must also be well commented
and otherwise follow good Java programming style.
 <p>
~/../public/P5/P5Solution.jar contains a program that 
meets the specifications of
this assignment.  If you have questions about what is required by that
part, it might be useful to run it.
