Programming assignment #4:  CSE 11 Fall 2003
</font>
</h2> <hr>

<p>
Here's a description of the fourth programming assignment for CSE 11,
Fall 2003. 
 </p><p>
In the previous assignment, there were a few things that we
didn't do, and things we could've done better.  Some of you may have noticed that if
the user isn't too careful, he or she could possibly crash the client in an
ungraceful manner.  In addition there are some features we would like to
add.  For instance, it'd be great if we could store some more information
related to a transaction,
such as what a user is interested in paying 11-dollars for, and
what a user is interested in buying with 11-dollars.  We'd like to store
an email address, but since this isn't something you want to be public knowledge,
we'll require that you know the user's password before getting their
email address.  And finally, it'd also be great if you could get a list of your
previous transactions.
 </p><p>
It's time we fixed these omissions.  At the same time you'll be learning
how to do error handling in Java, and how one class can inherit fields and methods
from another.  You'll find that classes will have a small amount of code,
and yet extend a class's abilities significantly.  This is part of the
goal of object oriented programming.
 </p><p>
&gt;&gt;&gt; Due deadline:  	Wed Oct 29 12:00noon
 </p><p>
&gt;&gt;&gt; Required solution files: BetterPerson.java
BetterAccount.java BuddyAccount.java TransAccount.java
NoBuddyException.java NoUserException.java ElevenDollar.java </p><p>

</p><h4>1. The Usual</h4>
First, make sure you've read chapters 7 and 8 of the textbook.  This
assignment uses material introduced and discussed there.
 <p>
Next, create a directory named "P4" under your cs11 home directory. Your
solution to this assignment should be turned in from that directory by the
due date and time.  Use the bundleP4 script to do that.  Follow the integrity
of scholarship rules for the course.

</p><h4>2. Some Unusual</h4>

In this assignment, you will extend some classes from the previous assignment.
We will provide correct versions of Person.class and Account.class for you
to use.  They will appear in the public/P4 directory after the due deadline
for P3. Please copy these to your P4 working directory and use them.  We will
use them when testing your P4 solution.

There will be a change to the Account class from P3.  An Account object maintains
a pointer to a Person object associated with the Account.  These protected visibility
accessor methods for it will be added:
<pre>protected Person getPerson()
protected void setPerson(Person p)
</pre>
 <p>
There will be no other changes to the specifications for the Person or
Account classes. Enhanced functionality will be obtained by extending
those classes and using the power of inheritance.
<b>3. BetterPerson.java</b>

A Person didn't really have a lot of information inside it in the previous
assignment.  Here we'll rectify this by adding a little more data to
Person to make it a bit more useful.  In particular, we want to add pieces
of data that would help make it easier to do 11Dollar trading.
 </p><p>
However, we're going to do something tricky--we're not going to modify
Person directly.  We've written it, it works, and instead of playing with
it some more, we're going to write a new class, BetterPerson.java, that
will extend the original Person.  This BetterPerson will have the
additional fields mentioned, but will rely on Person to handle some of the
original methods and the original data.
 </p><p>
Here's the information we'll be adding, which should be implemented 
using private instance variables:
</p><pre>email:
  a String equal to your email address.  Doesn't have to be your real one,
  but might aid others in contacting you if they want to trade.
  Will only be released to "buddies", i.e. people who know your password.
</pre>
<pre>trades:
  a String of things you're interested in trading for 11-dollars, delimited by spaces.
  ex:"surf_trip go_lessons short_stories"
</pre>

We will add accessors and mutators for these, and override netString(), and
provide two constructors, similar to the original Person.  The list of
BetterPerson's methods follows:
 <p>
Constructors:
</p><pre>public BetterPerson(String name, String password, String email, String trades)
</pre>
Creates a BetterPerson with the fields initialized.  Call a base class Person
constructor with this(name, password) to initialize those fields.
<br>
<pre>public BetterPerson(String netString)
</pre>
Creates a BetterPerson given a String of the format
"[nickname]\t[password]\t[email]\t[trades]"  Call a base class Person constructor to
handle the initialization of name and password.
 <p>
Accessors/Mutators:
</p><pre>public String getEmail()
public void setEmail(String email)
public String getTrades()
public void setTrades(String trades)
</pre>
 <p>

Utility methods:
</p><pre>public String toString()
</pre>
 Creates a String of "Nickname:" followed by the nickname, a newline, and
then "Password:" followed by the password and a newline, then "Email:" followed by
the email address and a newline, and finally
"Trades:" follwed by the trades string.
Use the Person toString() for the name and
password fields.
<pre>public String netString()
</pre>
 Creates a string of "[nickname]\t[password]\t[email]\t[trades]".  Once
again, use existing superclass method(s) to help.

<h4>3. BetterAccount.java</h4>
With this, we can now write BetterAccount to get and update the new fields
to and from the server.  While some of Account's methods must be
overridden, some don't rely on the contents of Person, and therefore don't
need modification in BetterAccount.
 <p>
The server has new messages for this part, to accommodate the new fields,
as well as the security changes.
</p><pre>GETINFO
   returns a string of the format
   "YOURINFO\t[nickname]\t[password]\t[email]\t[trades]"
</pre>
<pre>GETINFO\t[user]
   returns a string of the format
   "USERINFO\t[nickname]\t*SECRET*\t*PRIVATE*\t*[trades]"
</pre>
<pre>GETINFO\t[user]\t[password]
   returns a string of the format
   "USERINFO\t[nickname]\t[password]\t[email]\t[trades]"
</pre>
<pre>UPDATEINFO\t[nickname]\t[password]\t[email]\t[trades]
   Updates the information on the server.  Returns "UPDATE CONFIRMED"
</pre>
 <p>
BetterAccount will have the following methods in it to account for the new
changes.  Note that transferToAcct and checkBalance are just inherited
from Account's
original implementation.
 </p><p>
</p><pre>public BetterAccount()
</pre>
  Same constructor as Account(asks server for information, constructs a
Person and stores it), except we construct and assign a BetterPerson 
in the base Account.  You will not need, and should not use, an instance
variable in the BetterAccount class to point to this BetterPerson object.
<pre>public Person getInformation()
</pre>
   Asks server for information about the user and returns a BetterPerson.
Overrides Account's method.  Note this returns a Person--if it returned
BetterPerson, it would not override its parent.
<pre>public Person getInformation(String username)
</pre>
Asks server for information about another user and returns a
BetterPerson.  Overrides Account's method.
<pre>public String updateInformation(String newNick, String newPass, String newEmail, String newTrades)
</pre>
Sends an UPDATEINFO request to the server, of the format
"UPDATEINFO\t[nickname]\t[password]\t[email]\t[trades]".
 <p>
If all goes well, we'll have written a reasonably small amount of code to
increase the storage of a Person.  At this stage, if you modify
ElevenDollar to construct a BetterAccount instead of an Account(but still
leave it in an Account variable) everything should function except for
updating your information.  A few SavitchIn.readLines will easily fix
that.  You can add those now or wait until you're done with the other
classes.

</p><h4>4. TransAccount.java</h4>

It'd be really nice if, after making or receiving transfers, you could get
a record of what they were.  A TransactionAccount is pretty much the same as
an Account, except for an additional feature, that you can ask to review
previous transactions.
 <p>
The server will understand one new message for this part:

</p><pre>GET_HISTORY
</pre>
Tells the server to return a String containing information about all
previous transactions involving the owner of the account.  The String has 
a format like:
<pre>Tue Oct 21 20:48:40 PDT 2003	cs11f7	cs11f6	100	surfing lesson
Mon Oct 20 10:38:00 PDT 2003	cs11f6	cs11f7	150	tune up his car
Mon Oct 20 05:12:20 PDT 2003	cs11f7	cs11f3	30	cookies
Sun Oct 19 11:48:33 PDT 2003	cs11f3	cs11f7	40	donuts
</pre>
The fields in each transaction are separated by tab characters; transactions are
separated by newlines.  The fields in each transaction are:  Date and time,
source account name, destination account name, amount, and comment.
 <p>
Write TransAccount to extend BetterAccount, and add one more
method of the following signature:
</p><pre>public String getHistory()
</pre>
Returns the transaction history of your own transactions, in the same format
as received from the server.
 <p>
At this point you should be able to add a fifth option to ElevenDollar, to
retrieve your transaction history.  Modify ElevenDollar so it constructs a
TransAccount instead of a BetterAccount(but still places it in the same
Account variable)
 </p><p>
Since getting the history isn't something an ordinary Account can
do, you'll need to cast the Account reference, and either check
beforehand with an instanceof clause or afterwards with a try/catch
block, ready to catch a ClassCastException.  This is explained in more
detail under the heading "ElevenDollar.java".

</p><h4>5. BuddyAccount.java</h4>

Now we'll create a BuddyAccount to represent an account of another user,
someone whose password you know.  BuddyAccounts are like ordinary
BetterAccounts, in that you can get their complete information and their
balance.  Unlike ordinary accounts, however, you can neither transfer
money nor update their information. (That wouldn't be very buddy-like!)
 <p>
BuddyAccounts are also initialized a bit differently than normal
BetterAccounts too--the server doesn't usually give you the complete
information for users other than yourself.  You'll need someone's password
to prove to the server that you're their buddy.  You'll also need to keep
their login in a private variable, so that if you need to you can access
the server again and re-retrieve information.
 </p><p>
At this point, I remind you--please set your client password to something
that isn't anything like a real password you actually use, since to test
this feature out you'll naturally be telling people this password.
 </p><p>
There will be one more new message the server understands for this part,
so that you can get someone else's balance:
</p><pre>BALANCE\t[user]\t[password]
</pre>
Returns the balance of this user, if the password matches, in the form
"BALANCE IS [amount]".  Returns ERROR otherwise.
 <p>
BuddyAccount constructors take in a user's name and password.  It asks the
user for information, retrieves it, and places it in a new Person.  For
each of the methods, however, it must send a different message, or
sometimes refuse to send information at all.  The complete list of methods
you must add is below.
</p><pre>public BuddyAccount(String username, String password) throws NoBuddyException
</pre>
Create an new account.  Ask the server to retrieve the information of a
user with this name and password, and stores this in a Person variable.
Throws the declared exception on failure.
 <p>
Methods:
</p><pre>public Person getInformation() throws NoBuddyException
</pre>
Ask the server to retrieve the information on this buddy, using your
stored variable and the password from the stored BetterPerson.  Throws
the declared exception on failure.
 <p>
</p><pre>public String updateInformation(String newNick, String newPass)
   throws  UnsupportedOperationException
</pre>
[see part on Exceptions for details]
 <p>
</p><pre>public double checkBalance() throws NoBuddyException
</pre>
Sends a BALANCE request to the server.  For buddies, BALANCE is of the
format:"BALANCE\t[user]\t[password]".  As before, if ERROR is returned,
throw a NoBuddyException.  You'll also need to use the stored login
here as well.
 <p>
</p><pre>public String transferToAcct(String user, double amount, String comment)
   throws UnsupportedOperationException
</pre>
[see part on Exceptions for details]


<h4>6. ElevenDollar.java</h4>

ElevenDollar needs a couple of changes to make it work nicely with the added
functionality of the classes you are writing.  The first of which is to modify
the update function so it requests all five fields.  Optionally, you can
modify the update so that if you leave it blank, it will send the old
value, so you don't have to retype your previous information every time.
This is optional, however--all that's required is that the user types in
the information as before, but with five fields in the appropriate order.
 <p>
Printing the fields should be unchanged, if you used the toString()
operator to print out a Person.
 </p><p>
ElevenDollar also needs to provide an interface that lets you access
multiple accounts.  We'll handle this by letting the user choose to switch
accounts during execution.  We'll also be modifying the menu a bit so it
has two new options, and so that it says "account's" instead of "your".
See the following sample run:
</p><pre>
Welcome to the 11-dollar banking system
A)Retrieve personal information
B)Update account's personal information
C)Check account's balance
D)Transfer money to another account
E)View transaction history
F)Select a different account
X)Exit

</pre>
 <p>
A single Account variable will hold either a BuddyAccount or TransAccount,
depending on which account is currently active.  However, when requesting
a transaction history, you'll need to check to make sure the Account
you're looking at is a TransAccount.
 </p><p>
There are two suggested ways to do this.  The first option is to use
instanceof, the same way you checked for objects being equal.  Check to
see if the Account is a TransAccount before letting the user try to access
its history.
 </p><p>
The second is to attempt to cast it anyway.  If the Account turns out not
to be a TransAccount, it will throw a ClassCastException, which you can
then catch.  Then you can peacefully tell the user the operation isn't
allowed on this account.
 </p><p>
As a note, this isn't the cleanest of implementations, but it is a
reasonable workaround, and a small price to pay for the amount of code
we've reused.
 </p><p>

</p><h4>7. NoBuddyException.java, NoUserException.java, UnsupportedOperationException</h4>

Some of you may have used C or C++ before--  these languages have a number
of ways to handle runtime errors, the sort from bad data.  They're errors
like a divide by zero or an out-of-memory.  Often times the return value
of the function has some special case to report an error, such as
checkBalance returning -1.0.  But it doesn't really tell you what's going
on.  Even worse are constructors, which have no return value at all.
 <p>
Exceptions leap upwards through the stack of procedure calls--they're like
an instant return, except they return to a catch block.  So you can use
them to package up an explanation of the error and what caused it, which
is great for debugging.  You can also catch exceptions in an attempt to
keep running.
 </p><p>
Some of you may have noticed that when you get a runtime error, like a
NullPointerException, you get a bunch of procedure names and line
numbers--these say exactly where the program was, a computer version of "I
went here, this thing told me to go there, so I tried to find this house,
but it didn't exist!"
 </p><p>
If you've ever programmed in C, if you make the same mistake, your program
will say "Segmentation fault" and exit.  So three cheers for Java,
everyone.
 </p><p>
There are three kinds of exceptions we'll be taking care of in this
project.  This in no way will bulletproof your program from a clueless
user, but it will gracefully handle some of the more common cases
introduced in this portion.  Each one is a bit different.
 </p><p>
</p><pre>NoBuddyException
</pre>
Some exceptions do not have to be declared before being thrown.  In
BuddyAccount, we'll handle the case of a user giving an invalid user and
password by creating a NoBuddyException, which extends RuntimeException.
It will have one constructor, which takes an error message String.  This
String is then passed to its superclass, RuntimeException, which will
store it away in case the handler wants to take a look at it.
 <p>
</p><pre>NoUserException
</pre>
Some exceptions do need to be declared when thrown.  In TransAccount,
we'll handle the unlikely case of an invalid user trying to access their
history.  Define a class NoUserException which extends Exception.  Unlike
RuntimeExceptions, these must be declared in a throws clause of the method
signature, so that anyone using it knows this can happen.
 <p>
</p><pre>UnsupportedOperationException
</pre>
There are many descendant classes of Exception already written by Java.
UnsupportedOperationException is particularly
suited to the case when a user attempts to transfer money out of a
BuddyAccount, or update its information.  Throw this exception should
either of those methods be called on a BuddyAccount.
 <p>
Now that all this error information is coming out, create a try-catch
block in ElevenDollar to handle individual cases of Exceptions.  If the
user creates an exception, you should catch it and report the error, and
continue executing the loop with the menu in it.
 </p><p>
There are, of course, all the holes in P3, such as checkBalance, or the
normal Account's constructor.  Ordinarily we would patch that up too, but
part of P4 is to demonstrate that we can reuse P3's code without making
<i>any</i> modifications.  (Well almost none:  Account didn't have a way for
subclasses to access its Person, so that was added.)


</p><h4>8: Hints</h4>
<ol>
<li> 
Start Early.  Or again, at least try not to start too late.
</li><li> 
Read the README, perhaps several times.  Unlike the P3's README, some of
the methods are a little less obvious.  Think a bit before diving into the
code.  Try to implement them in your head and see what happens, and ask
questions before the due date.
</li><li> 
Exceptions are among the simplest classes in the world to write, so don't
be intimidated by the number of them.  They're approximately five lines,
two of which are close braces.  Don't forget to comment them though, to
say what the exception is about.
</li><li> 
Getting a field out of a String message is something you might end up doing
often.
It might help to write a utility function String getField(String input,
int n) that will find the nth field and return that.
</li><li> 
Use the following checklist for things you need to do:
<pre>  Create BetterPerson.java
  Create BetterAccount.java
  Create TransAccount.java to have Transaction ability.
  Create BuddyAccount.java to access accounts that aren't your own.
  Add Exceptions to BuddyAccount.
  Modify ElevenDollar to switch accounts, use TransAccount's ability, and catch Exceptions.
</pre>
</li></ol>
