    idle vm only loses pages if memory is scarce in the system
  b sometimes
    it's random. process with most lottery tickets has most probability
  c sometimes
    may read unique items that are not in the cache 
  d sometimes
  e always
  f always
  g sometimes
    belady's is optimal. lru may not be
  h sometimes
  i never
  j sometimes

2 a vmm doesn't know about os's applications. can't tell the difference between
    an idle loop and a scientific computation.

  e used in microkernels to redirect system calls to the appropriate user-level
    application. system calls to the kernel are trampolined back up to userland.

3 a microkernels reduce abstractions used to a minimal set. exokernels remove
    as many abstractions as possible and make the hardware visible to the user.
  b mcpi = memory cycles per instruction. mach code used a lot of memory, which     means a large working set, which would cause more cache misses on the
    application's side.
