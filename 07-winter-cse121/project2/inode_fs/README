The mkfs formats the file disk file. It takes two arguments: disk file and size of disk
(in 512 blocks).

Inode.c implements a file sytem similar to the impementation of early FFS 
(with out cylinder groups and without space locality). The Inode.h have
the directory entry structure that store the file name (max 28 bytes), 
a boolean to indicate the whether the entry is a regular file or directory 
and inode number if the entry is a regular file, first data block number if 
the entry is a directory. Each data block of directory stores
14 file entries and a pointer to the next data block.
