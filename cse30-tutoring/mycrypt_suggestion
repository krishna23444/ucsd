Hi Rick,

Here are a couple suggestions for mycrypt:

1. In the encrypting routine, write every set of bits
back to memory in reverse order. This is a "symmetric"
operation so it can be incorporated well into the assignment.
This would probably require shifting bitmasks in a loop.

2. Add a -s option so that the user can search for a string within an
encrypted file. This would involve encrypting the string and then testing
the bitpattern of the string against each bit in the encrypted file.
However, this might be a little tedious to implement in assembly..

3. Some type of primitive file-compression would be interesting..
Not sure about this one though.

Hope that helped.
