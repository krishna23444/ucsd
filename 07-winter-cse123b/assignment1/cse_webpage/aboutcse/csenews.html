The <b><a href="http://www.jacobsschool.ucsd.edu/">Jacobs School</a></b> and 
<b><a href="http://www.sdsc.edu/">San Diego Supercomputer Center</a></b> are launching an environmental education 
initiative to keep middle school girls excited about science. The UCSD team will help San Diego county students 
monitor the air quality, solar radiation, and other environmental factors surrounding their own schools in an effort
to make science applicable to them.
<b><a href="http://www.cse.ucsd.edu/users/ferrante/">Jeanne Ferrante</a></b>, CSE professor and principal investigator 
on the project, says "One of the best ways to keep girls engaged is to show them how engineering and computing 
connects with issues in their own lives."

<b><a href="http://bioinf.ucsd.edu/~mchaisso/">Mark Chaisson</a></b> and colleagues, continues to chart new evolutionary

Microinversions are a relatively new discovery, one that can provide insight into the divergent relationships of

The National Science Foundation has funded the Temporal Dynamics of Learning Center, a research initiative that will 
investigate the importance of time in learning with the hope of improving teaching techniques. The Center is 
multi-disciplinary--pulling researchers from such far-flung fields as machine learning, psychology, cognitive science, 
neuroscience, molecular genetics, biophysics, mathematics, and education--and will involve over 40 scientists from the U.S., 
Canada, and Australia. The Center's organization is taking a cue from its subject matter; rather than having researchers 
report their findings to one another, scientists will be assembled into one of four interdisciplinary teams to study the same 
questions using different methods, skills, and expertise. Hypotheses and findings in the area of teaching techniques will be 
deployed at UCSD's <b><a href="http://preuss.ucsd.edu/">Preuss School</a></b>, a middle and high school for motivated, 
low-income students located on the UCSD campus. You can read more about the Center and its planned research by clicking

Online DVD rental company Netflix has created a competition to improve their movie recommendation program and tapped CSE's
Charles Elkan to help design the system. A veteran organizer of data mining competitions, Elkan consulted for Netflix to 
create a leader board, design the competition's timeline, and advocated for data segregation to discourage systems geared

Health grant to create a breakthrough method that will radically streamline the way the human genome is sequenced. In order 
to sequence the 23 pairs of human chromosomes, its DNA must be cut into tens of million to hundreds of millions of pieces. 
Pevzner is developing techniques to computationally reassemble these chromosomes by piecing together the overlapping ends 
of all the fragments after they have been sequenced. The trio of researchers will attempt to simultaneously sequence more
than 1 billion individual DNA molecules. You can read more about the research by clicking

CSE recently took part in Operation College Freedom, a disaster exercise on the UCSD campus that tested
new technologies designed for first-responders. Coordinated by San Diego's
<b><a href="http://mmstexercise.calit2.net/">Metropolitan Medical Strike Team (MMST)</a></b>, the drill
was a cooperative effort between <b><a href="http://www.calit2.net/">Calit2</a></b>,
<b><a href="http://medschool.ucsd.edu/">UCSD's School of Medicine</a></b>, law enforcement, and
first-responders. <b><a href="https://www.wiisard.org/">WIISARD</a></b>, or the Wireless Internet Information
System for Medical Response in Disasters, was one of 12 primary technologies deployed during the exercise.
A system for the tracking of mass casualties, triage, and managing all medical information, WIISARD combines
state-of-the-art networking, data collection, display devices and database services to produce a consistent,

On April 1st, US News and World Report released its 2006 reputation rankings of graduate programs
in the United States.  UCSD's computer science and engineering department was elevated to the
13th position overall -- the largest jump of any program in the top 30. In addition, UCSD was
ranked among the top twenty in all computer science specialties (9th in Systems, 14th in Theory,
17th in Programming Languages and 19th in Artificial Intelligence).  Finally, UCSD's
interdisciplinary program in Genomics, Genetics and Bioinformatics was ranked 6th in the nation.
Over the twelve years in which US News has ranked graduate computer science programs, UCSD's rise
has been unprecedented and unmatched by any program in the country.  This recognition has mirrored
the tremendous growth of the department over this time, the enthusiasm of its students, staff and

With the announcement of this year's COSMOS program, the department of Computer Science &amp; Engineering will again be
taking part in this program that gives talented high school students a taste of college life. COSMOS (California
State Summer School for Mathematics and Science) is a month-long residential program designed to encourage students
to continue their interest in science. The curriculum is broken into seven units known as clusters. This year's
computer science cluster will be titled "Adventures in Media Computing" and will be overseen by Professor Joe Pasquale.
CSE lecturers Paul Kube and Beth Simon (along with Christine Alvarado from Harvey Mudd College) will assist.

UCSD's William J. von Liebig Center for Entrepreneurism and Technology Advancement has awarded approximately
$430,000 to nine projects led by Jacobs School of Engineering faculty, including three from CSE. Pavel Pevzner
and Vineet Bafna will be collaborating on a software project to process the data sets that result from mass
spectrometry, or the measurement of wavelengths of light or other electromagnetic radiation.
Yannis Papakonstantinou will use his award to develop app2you, a platform for the construction of innovative web
applications. David Kriegman plans to leverage the financial resources of his award to develop a powerful suite
of software products for processing human faces in digital images and videos. The von Liebig Center was set up
in 2001 to foster entrepreneurism education and to provide funding and advisory services to technology projects

Postdoc Ben Raphael, along with CSE's Pavel Pevzner, has developed algorithms to understand how a cancer genome
breaks apart and gets put back together. The undertaking is a joint venture with the UC San Francisco Cancer Center,
Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute, Amplicon Express, Evrogen JSC, Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, and the Joint
Genome Institute. Raphael's technique is called End Sequence Profiling (ESP), and exploits the fact that the mutagenetic
processes that result in a tumor are similar to that of evolutionary genomic rearrangements, except they occur on a
vastly expedited timescale. ESP determines some of a tumor's DNA base pairs and infers the missing pieces from
comparisons with the unchanged genome. These data then suggest areas of the genome that UCSF Cancer Center researchers
should examine more closely. You can read more about Ben Raphael's research, which is published in this month's <i>Genome
Research</i>
