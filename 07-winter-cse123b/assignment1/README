We used the multi-thread approach, because it's more efficient than
multi-process, and it's way cooler than event-driven.  Each thread deals
with a new connection.

Our dynamic persistent connection starts at 2 minutes for a single thread 
running, and is reduced linearly by 10 seconds for each additional thread 
running.  Thus, the more people connected, the less time each gets to hold
its connection open.

We process an .htaccess file in the document_root directory, if one exists,
and allow or block IPs, hostnames, or all accordingly.  Only complete IPs are
supported.  All files being served are governed by the one .htaccess file, 
if it exists.

The server runs on ieng6, but ieng9 lacks some of the libraries that it
requires.

We support the desired filetypes.  The server functions properly in every
way specified by the assignment, to the best of our knowledge.
