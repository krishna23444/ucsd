TritonShare P2P Assignment

Group:
-Erik Buchanan  ebuchana@ucsd.edu A05479081
-Nitay Joffe    njoffe@ucsd.edu   A05229402

Functionality:
We implemented all of the functionality in the writeup for the TritonShare P2P
protocol.  All of the functionality works and has been tested to some degree.

We tested our protocol with a combination of GUI and NOGUI TritonShare
applications, both running them individually and with test scripts.
We tried to use the modelchecker (as you, Calvin, already know) but ultimately
we didn't get it working.

Nitay gave up his 64-bit crusade once he found out you can compile in 32-bit
mode using -m32.

This project was awesome but Mace is really bulky and hard to manage.
