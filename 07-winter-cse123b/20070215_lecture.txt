- send/receive semantics
  - synchronous
    - block until reply comes back
  - asynchronous
    - send request, go off and do other things
- process model
  - single process
    - avoid context switch overheads
  - multiple process
- buffer model
  - avoid data copies
- select has high overhead
  - must copy large data structures into and out of kernel each time to specify
    which fd's program is interested in
  - common case: very few fd's have data available
- alternative: /dev/poll
  - tell it what we're interseted in
  - use ioctl()'s to add and check
- rpc
  - client doesn't know if server actually executed function
    - make operations idempotent
      - ex. use x = 2 instead of x += 2
      - nfs does this, all its operations are idempotent
